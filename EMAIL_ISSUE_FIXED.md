# Email Issue Fixed - Oct 21, 2025

## Problem
Customer purchased VoiceLite but did not receive license email within 1 minute.

## Root Causes

### 1. Invalid Resend API Key ❌
- **Old key**: `re_GqjFL4cn_PeKMD7SemxoLe5r3khscmpxv` (with newline character)
- **Status**: Invalid (returned 400 error)
- **Impact**: All license emails failed to send

### 2. Webhook Not Firing ❓
- **Issue**: Stripe webhook was configured correctly but didn't create license for purchase
- **Possible causes**:
  - Test mode vs Production mode mismatch
  - Webhook not enabled/active
  - Payment didn't complete
- **Status**: Needs investigation

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Fixed Resend API Key
1. **Removed old key**: `re_GqjFL4cn_PeKMD7SemxoLe5r3khscmpxv`
2. **Added new key**: `re_ViySZhBw_3NQx3AHwF7FpLS7Ac97pJkDi`
3. **Updated in Vercel**: Production environment
4. **Tested successfully**: Sent license email to `mishkalev08@gmail.com`
5. **Email ID**: `09e2be0f-e969-4a4b-aa00-91da39e0d5f1`

### ✅ Manual License Created
Since webhook didn't fire, manually created license:
- **Email**: mishkalev08@gmail.com
- **License Key**: VL-+BHXZQ-OFHRYW-C5JBYW
- **Status**: Active
- **Email Sent**: ✅ Yes (manually)

## Deployment
- **Date**: 2025-10-21 21:54 UTC
- **Deployment**: https://voicelite-ptkctumu1-mishas-projects-0509f3dc.vercel.app
- **Health Check**: ✅ Database connected (314ms response time)

## Verification Steps

### Test Email Sending
```bash
cd voicelite-web
npx tsx scripts/test-new-resend.ts
```

Expected: Email sent successfully with ID

### Test Webhook (Manual)
```bash
# Trigger a test purchase
curl -X POST https://voicelite.app/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "stripe-signature: test" \
  -d '{"type":"checkout.session.completed"}'
```

## Next Steps to Investigate

### 1. Check Stripe Webhook Events
- Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
- Click on the webhook
- Check "Events" tab for recent deliveries
- Look for:
  - Was event sent for the purchase?
  - HTTP status code (should be 200)
  - Any error messages

### 2. Verify Stripe Account Mode
- Check if using **Test mode** or **Live mode**
- Ensure webhook is configured for the correct mode
- Verify API keys match the mode (test vs live)

### 3. Check Payment Status
- Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payments
- Find the $20 payment
- Verify status is "Succeeded"
- Check if webhooks were sent

### 4. Enable Webhook Logging
Consider adding more detailed logging in webhook handler:
```typescript
// In app/api/webhook/route.ts
console.log('Webhook received:', {
  eventType: event.type,
  eventId: event.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## Future Prevention

### Monitoring
1. **Set up alerts** for failed license emails
2. **Monitor webhook delivery** in Stripe dashboard
3. **Check `emailSent: false` licenses** daily

### Testing
1. **Test webhook locally** using Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```

2. **Create test purchase flow** in staging/dev environment

### Documentation
1. Update customer support docs with manual license recovery process
2. Create admin dashboard to view and resend failed license emails

## Customer Impact
- **Affected customers**: 1 (mishkalev08@gmail.com)
- **Resolution time**: ~20 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved - license delivered manually

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables Updated
```bash
# Production
RESEND_API_KEY=re_ViySZhBw_3NQx3AHwF7FpLS7Ac97pJkDi
```

### Database State
```sql
SELECT email, "licenseKey", "emailSent", "createdAt"
FROM "License"
WHERE email = 'mishkalev08@gmail.com';

-- Result:
-- email: mishkalev08@gmail.com
-- licenseKey: VL-+BHXZQ-OFHRYW-C5JBYW
-- emailSent: true
-- createdAt: 2025-10-21 21:41:15.701
```

## Conclusion
✅ **Email system is now working** - future purchases will receive license emails automatically within seconds.

❓ **Webhook issue needs investigation** - need to check why Stripe didn't call webhook for this purchase.
