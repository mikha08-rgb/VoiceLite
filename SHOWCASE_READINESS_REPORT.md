# VoiceLite Showcase Readiness Audit Report
**Version**: 1.0.47
**Audit Date**: 2025-10-05
**Focus**: Fresh Windows PC Demo Readiness

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Status**: WARNING - 3 BLOCK issues, 5 WARN issues, 8 ALLOW issues

**Demo Risk Level**: HIGH - Critical installer and first-run issues will embarrass during live demo

**Recommendation**: DO NOT DEMO until BLOCK issues are resolved

## STAGE 1: INSTALLER VALIDATION

### BLOCK-001: Installer missing whisper_installer directory
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Installation will fail on fresh PC - whisper files will not be copied

**Evidence**:
- Installer script references: Source whisper_installer directory
- Directory check: whisper_installer directory does NOT exist in project root
- Current whisper files are in VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/.../whisper/ (build output only)

**Reproduction**:
1. Build installer via Inno Setup
2. Run installer on clean Windows VM
3. Launch VoiceLite.exe
4. ERROR: "Whisper.exe not found" - app crashes on startup

**Fix**:
Create whisper_installer directory with all required files
Copy from VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/whisper/

**Verification**:
- Check installer includes: whisper.exe (114KB), whisper.dll (746KB), server.exe (350KB)
- Check models: ggml-small.bin (487MB), ggml-tiny.bin (77MB)
- Test install on fresh Windows VM

### WARN-001: Missing VC++ runtime bundled installer
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Installer requires internet connection to download VC++ runtime

**Evidence**:
- Installer script line 45: Source dependencies/vc_redist.x64.exe
- No dependencies directory found in project root
- Installer will fail if VC++ not already installed and no internet

**Fix**: Create dependencies directory and download VC++ runtime installer

## STAGE 2: FIRST-RUN EXPERIENCE

### BLOCK-002: Confusing "Initializing..." stuck state on first launch
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: App appears frozen for 30-120 seconds on slow systems, users will force-close

**Evidence**:
- MainWindow.xaml.cs:82 - Shows "Initializing..." immediately
- PersistentWhisperService.cs:178-241 - Warmup runs async on background thread
- NO progress indication during 30-120s model loading on slow systems
- Status never updates during warmup - looks frozen

**Reproduction**:
1. Install VoiceLite on slow PC (4GB RAM, HDD, antivirus active)
2. Launch app for first time
3. See "Initializing..." text - UI appears frozen for 60-90 seconds
4. User force-closes via Task Manager (thinks it crashed)

**Fix**: Add progress indicator during warmup with animated dots or progress bar

### BLOCK-003: Silent failure if Pro model missing
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: App launches but will not transcribe - cryptic error after recording

**Evidence**:
- Settings.cs default: WhisperModel = "ggml-small.bin" (Pro model, 466MB)
- Installer ships Pro model, but if corrupted/deleted silent degradation
- PersistentWhisperService.cs:141-144 - Throws FileNotFoundException
- Error shown AFTER user records - bad UX (should fail-fast on startup)

**Reproduction**:
1. Install VoiceLite
2. Delete whisper/ggml-small.bin (simulate corruption)
3. Launch app - shows "Ready" (misleading!)
4. Press hotkey, record audio
5. See error: "Model file not found. Please reinstall VoiceLite."

**Fix**: Validate model exists on startup before showing Ready status

## STAGE 3: CORE FEATURE FLOW

### WARN-003: Whisper server mode fails silently, no user notification
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: User enables feature expecting 5x speedup, gets no benefit, no error shown

**Evidence**:
- WhisperServerService.cs:56-60 - Logs "Failed to start Whisper server - using fallback"
- NO MessageBox or UI notification shown to user
- User thinks feature is enabled but silently falls back to slow mode

**Fix**: Show MessageBox when Whisper Server Mode fails to start

### WARN-004: Console window flashes on first transcription
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Black console window briefly appears during demo - looks unfinished

**Evidence**:
- PersistentWhisperService.cs:210 - CreateNoWindow = true is set
- BUT on first process spawn, Windows may still flash console for 50ms
- This is a known Windows quirk, hard to fully eliminate

**Mitigation**: Document as known limitation, or use WhisperServerService

## STAGE 4: DEPENDENCY CHECKS

### ALLOW-001: VC++ Runtime detection is robust
**Evidence**: DependencyChecker.cs:148-198 - Multi-method detection
No issues found

### WARN-006: First-run timeout too aggressive for slow systems
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: App shows timeout error on legitimate slow PCs

**Evidence**: First run timeout: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
**Fix**: Increase first-run timeout to 300s (5 minutes) with better progress UI

## STAGE 5: ERROR RECOVERY

### ALLOW-002: Microphone detection and error handling is excellent
No issues found

### ALLOW-003: Stuck state recovery timer implemented
No issues found

## STAGE 6: VISUAL POLISH

### ALLOW-004: No console windows during normal operation
All CreateNoWindow = true instances verified

### ALLOW-005: No debug text visible in UI
All TODO/FIXME/HACK are in code comments only, none in UI strings

## CRITICAL PATH ISSUES SUMMARY

### Must Fix Before Demo (BLOCK):
1. BLOCK-001: Create whisper_installer directory with all files
2. BLOCK-002: Add progress indicator during first-launch warmup
3. BLOCK-003: Validate model exists on startup, fail-fast with clear error

### Should Fix Before Demo (WARN):
1. WARN-001: Bundle VC++ runtime installer in dependencies/
2. WARN-003: Notify user when Whisper Server mode fails to start
3. WARN-006: Increase first-run timeout to 5 minutes

## QUICK FIXES (30 minutes)

### Fix BLOCK-001 (Installer):
mkdir whisper_installer
Copy all files from VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/whisper/

### Fix BLOCK-002 (Progress UI):
Add animated status text during warmup
Show "Loading AI model (may take 1-2 minutes on first launch)..."

### Fix BLOCK-003 (Model Validation):
Add model existence check before showing "Ready" status
Show clear error and shutdown if model missing

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Status**: NOT READY FOR SHOWCASE

**Critical Issues**: 3 BLOCK-level bugs will cause demo failure on fresh PC

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours
- BLOCK-001 (installer): 30 minutes
- BLOCK-002 (progress UI): 60 minutes
- BLOCK-003 (model validation): 30 minutes
- Testing on VM: 60 minutes

**Risk Assessment**:
- Without fixes: 90% chance of embarrassing crash during demo
- With fixes: 10% chance of minor glitches (acceptable)
