## **Combined Workflow Examples**

### Example 1: Architecture Audit
```
1. "Use ast-grep to find all static singletons"
   ‚Üí Identifies ApiClient.Client, ErrorLogger, PersistentWhisperService

2. "Vibe check: Should I refactor all 3 singletons at once or one at a time?"
   ‚Üí Suggests starting with ErrorLogger (lowest risk)

3. "Use Semgrep to scan MainWindow.xaml.cs for code smells"
   ‚Üí Finds complexity hotspots, coupling issues

4. "Use Supabase to query analytics: which services crash most often?"
   ‚Üí Identifies high-risk services to refactor carefully
```

### Example 2: Database Migration
```
1. "Use Supabase to show current schema for 'licenses' table"
   ‚Üí Reviews current structure

2. "Vibe check: Should I add indexes before or after adding new columns?"
   ‚Üí Suggests order to minimize downtime

3. "Use Supabase to create migration for new 'grace_period_days' column"
   ‚Üí Generates Prisma migration

4. "Use Semgrep to scan the new migration for SQL injection risks"
   ‚Üí Validates migration is safe
```

### Example 3: Payment Security Review
```
1. "Use Semgrep to scan voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/ for vulnerabilities"
   ‚Üí Finds potential issues

2. "Use Stripe MCP to show recent failed webhook events"
   ‚Üí Identifies payment flow issues

3. "Vibe check: Should I refactor webhook handling or add more error logging first?"
   ‚Üí Suggests prioritization

4. "Use GitHub MCP to create issue for webhook refactoring"
   ‚Üí Tracks work
```

### Example 4: Refactoring Safety Check
```
1. "Use ast-grep to find all usages of SettingsManager"
   ‚Üí Lists 47 usages across 12 files

2. "Vibe check: Can I safely extract SettingsManager with 47 usages?"
   ‚Üí Suggests incremental approach

3. "Use Semgrep to check if extraction introduces security issues"
   ‚Üí Validates no new vulnerabilities

4. "Use Supabase to query: how many users hit settings-related errors?"
   ‚Üí Assesses risk of breaking settings
```
