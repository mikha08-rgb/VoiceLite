## 🐛 What Was Fixed

### The Critical Bug (v1.0.88)
**Symptom**: Transcription completely broken - recordings worked but never transcribed

**Root Cause**: AudioRecorder.cs line 472
```csharp
// BROKEN CODE:
if (AudioFileReady != null) {  // Event had no subscribers!
    SaveMemoryBufferToTempFile(audioData);
}
// Result: Temp file never created → transcription never triggered
```

**The Fix**: AudioRecorder.cs line 471-473
```csharp
// FIXED CODE:
// CRITICAL FIX: Always save to temp file for transcription
// Don't depend on event subscribers - the file is needed regardless
SaveMemoryBufferToTempFile(audioData);
// Result: Transcription works every time!
```

### Why v1.0.89 Failed
- v1.0.89 installer was built BEFORE the fix was committed
- Timeline issue: Build at 1:26 AM, commit at 1:27 AM
- Installer contained old broken code

### Why v1.0.90 Works
- ✅ Clean rebuild from source WITH fix included
- ✅ Verified in local testing - transcription works perfectly
- ✅ Proper version bump to avoid confusion
- ✅ All version files synchronized
