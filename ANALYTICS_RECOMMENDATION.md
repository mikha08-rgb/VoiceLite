# Analytics Recommendation for VoiceLite Launch

## TL;DR: Stick with Google Analytics (It's Already Working!)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Google Analytics 4 is **fully configured and working** in production
**Verification:** Checked voicelite.app source - GA script loads correctly
**My Recommendation:** **Don't change it. Use what you have.**

          {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' plausible.io;`
          }

4. ‚úÖ **Manual spreadsheet** (track metrics hourly)

**Optional - Add in 5 minutes:**
- **Vercel Analytics** (just enable in dashboard for performance data)

**Don't change:**
- ‚ùå Don't switch to Plausible/PostHog/etc. yet
- ‚ùå Don't waste time migrating analytics before launch

### **Why Stick with GA:**

1. **It's already working** - Verified in production
2. **Free forever** - No cost concerns
3. **Industry standard** - Everyone knows how to use it
4. **Feature-rich** - More data than alternatives
5. **Focus on launch** - Don't waste time on analytics migration

### **Week 2 (After Launch Settles):**

If privacy is important to your brand positioning:

## Final Answer

**Q: Is GA the best option, or should we do an alternative?**

**A: GA is already working perfectly. Stick with it for launch.**

- You have it set up ‚úÖ
- It's deployed to production ‚úÖ
- It's loading correctly ‚úÖ
- It's free ‚úÖ
- It gives you all the data you need for Day 1-2 ‚úÖ

**Don't fix what isn't broken.** Launch with GA, then evaluate alternatives in Week 2 if needed.

**Time saved by not switching:** 1-2 hours
**Better use of that time:** Write Reddit posts, test app, sleep before launch

**Go with GA. You're ready to launch.** üöÄ
