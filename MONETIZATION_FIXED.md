## üöÄ Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Generate Secure Keys
```powershell
.\generate-secure-keys.ps1
```
Save the generated keys securely!

### Step 2: Deploy License Server to Railway

1. Push your changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add secure license server"
git push
```

2. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Create new project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
4. Select your repository and `/license-server` folder
5. Add environment variables:
   - `API_KEY` (from step 1)
   - `ADMIN_KEY` (from step 1)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from Stripe)
   - `DATABASE_PATH=/data/licenses.db`

6. Add a volume for database persistence:
   - Settings ‚Üí Volumes ‚Üí Mount to `/data`

7. Generate domain (copy the URL)

### Step 3: Configure Stripe

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/webhook/stripe`
3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
4. Copy webhook secret to Railway environment

### Step 4: Update Your App

1. **Desktop Client**
   - The current open release no longer includes `SimpleLicenseManager.cs`.
   - If you maintain a commercial fork, update your legacy licensing component with the new server URL.

2. Rebuild the app (for legacy forks only):
```bash
cd VoiceLite
dotnet publish VoiceLite/VoiceLite.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```

3. Create new ZIP with the updated app (legacy builds)
4. Upload to Google Drive
5. Update download link if needed

### Step 5: Set Up Email (Choose One)

#### Option A: Gmail (Quick Testing)
1. Create Gmail app password
2. Add to Railway:
   - `GMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com`
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password`

#### Option B: SendGrid (Professional)
1. Create SendGrid account
2. Get API key
3. Add to Railway:
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key`
   - `FROM_EMAIL=licenses@voicelite.app`

### Step 6: Update Stripe Payment Link

Your current test link needs to be replaced with a live link:

1. Go to Stripe ‚Üí Payment Links
2. Create new payment link for $9/month
3. Add metadata field: `license_type` = `Pro`
4. Set success URL: `https://voicelite.app/success`
5. Replace test link in `docs/index.html`

### Step 7: Test Everything

1. **Test License Generation:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api/generate \
  -H "x-admin-key: YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "license_type": "Pro"}'
```

2. **Test Payment Flow:**
   - Make a test purchase
   - Check email for license
   - Try activating in app

## üìã Final Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Railway server deployed and running
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] Database volume mounted for persistence
- [ ] Stripe webhook configured
- [ ] Email service configured (Gmail/SendGrid)
- [ ] License server URL updated in app
- [ ] App rebuilt with new server URL
- [ ] New ZIP uploaded to Google Drive
- [ ] Stripe moved from test to live mode
- [ ] Payment link updated on website

## üí∞ Revenue Model

Your current setup:
- **Free**: 10 minutes/day usage
- **Pro**: $9/month unlimited + offline

This is good! The 10-minute limit is enough to hook users but creates friction for heavy users.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Keep Code Private**: Don't make the repo public if you want to monetize
2. **Obfuscate the App**: Consider using ConfuserEx to protect your compiled app
3. **Monitor Usage**: Check Railway logs regularly for issues
4. **Backup Database**: Download license database regularly from Railway

## üéØ You're 90% Done!

The hard part is complete. You just need to:
1. Deploy the server (15 minutes)
2. Configure Stripe webhook (5 minutes)
3. Set up email service (10 minutes)
4. Test the flow (15 minutes)

Total time to launch: ~45 minutes

Good luck with your launch! üöÄ
