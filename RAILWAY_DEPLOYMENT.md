```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on your project
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Add these variables:

```env
API_KEY=GENERATE_A_STRONG_32_CHAR_KEY_HERE
ADMIN_KEY=DIFFERENT_STRONG_32_CHAR_KEY_HERE
PORT=3000
DATABASE_PATH=./data/licenses.db
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Generate Strong Keys:**
Use this tool: https://passwordsgenerator.net/
- Length: 32 characters
- Include: Letters, Numbers
- Exclude: Similar characters

Example keys (DO NOT USE THESE):
- API_KEY: `kP9xT2mN5qR8vB3wY6zC1fG4hJ7sL0aE`

### Step 5: Get Your Server URL
1. In Railway dashboard, click on your project
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Under "Domains", click "Generate Domain"
4. You'll get a URL like: `voicelite-server.up.railway.app`
5. Test it: `https://voicelite-server.up.railway.app/api/check`

## Update VoiceLite App

### Files to Update:
1. **VoiceLite\VoiceLite\Services\LicenseManager.cs**
   - Line 21: Change `http://localhost:3000` to `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app`
   - Line 22: Change `your-secret-api-key-change-this` to your API_KEY

2. **VoiceLite\VoiceLite\Services\PaymentProcessor.cs**
   - Line 20: Change `http://localhost:3000` to `https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app`

### Rebuild Application:
```bash
cd VoiceLite
dotnet build VoiceLite.sln -c Release
```

## Test Production Setup

### 1. Check Server Health:
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api/check
```
Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### 2. Generate Test License:
```bash
# You'll need to do this from your local admin tool with the production server
node admin.js generate test@example.com Personal
```

### 3. Test License Activation:
1. Run VoiceLite.exe
2. Help â†’ Enter License
3. Enter the test license
4. Should activate successfully

## Production Checklist

âœ… **Before Going Live:**
- [ ] Strong API_KEY generated (32+ characters)
- [ ] Different ADMIN_KEY generated
- [ ] Railway deployment successful
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] VoiceLite app updated with production URLs
- [ ] Test license activation works
- [ ] Database persists between deployments

âœ… **Security:**
- [ ] GitHub repo is PRIVATE
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway (not in code)
- [ ] API keys are unique and strong
- [ ] No sensitive data in git history

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot connect to license server"**
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify URL in VoiceLite code
- Ensure https:// not http://

**"Unauthorized" error**
- Check API_KEY matches in both Railway and VoiceLite
- Ensure no extra spaces in keys

**Database resets on deploy**
- Use Railway's persistent volume for database
- Or use Railway's PostgreSQL addon (also free)
