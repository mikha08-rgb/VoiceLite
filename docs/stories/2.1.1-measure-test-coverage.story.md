# Story 2.1.1: Measure Test Coverage & Fix Failing Tests

## Status
ReadyForReview

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to measure the actual test coverage percentage and fix all failing tests,
**so that** I have a baseline understanding of test quality and all tests pass reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Actual test coverage % measured and documented (target: ≥80% overall, ≥75% Services/)
2. [ ] Coverage report generated showing gaps by service/module
3. [ ] All failing tests fixed (currently 1 known failure: `MemoryLeakStressTest.ServiceDisposal_Performance_Fast`)
4. [ ] All flaky/timing-out tests identified and documented
5. [ ] Coverage gaps documented by priority (critical services first)
6. [ ] Baseline coverage report committed to repository

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Measure Current Test Coverage (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Run tests with XPlat Code Coverage using existing coverlet.runsettings
  - Command: `dotnet test VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/VoiceLite.Tests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/coverlet.runsettings`
- [ ] Locate generated coverage.cobertura.xml file in TestResults/
- [ ] Generate human-readable HTML coverage report (use ReportGenerator or similar)
  - `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool` (if not installed)
  - `reportgenerator -reports:**/coverage.cobertura.xml -targetdir:coverage-report -reporttypes:Html`
- [ ] Document overall coverage % and per-service breakdown
- [ ] Identify services below 80% coverage threshold

### Task 2: Fix Failing Tests (AC: 3)
- [ ] Fix `MemoryLeakStressTest.ServiceDisposal_Performance_Fast`
  - Known issue: PersistentWhisperService takes 5s to dispose (expected <500ms)
  - Root cause: Slow process termination in whisper.exe cleanup
  - Solution options:
    1. Increase timeout threshold to 6000ms (pragmatic)
    2. Optimize PersistentWhisperService.Dispose() to kill process faster
    3. Skip test in CI but keep for manual performance validation
  - Choose solution and implement fix
- [ ] Re-run all tests to verify 100% pass rate
- [ ] Document fix in test comments

### Task 3: Identify Flaky/Skipped Tests (AC: 4)
- [ ] Review test output for skipped tests (marked with `[SKIP]`)
  - Known skipped: 14+ tests (SystemTrayManagerTests, WhisperServiceTests, etc.)
  - Reason: WPF UI testing limitations
- [ ] Document why each test is skipped
- [ ] Categorize skipped tests:
  - Acceptable (WPF limitations, manual testing required)
  - Should be fixed (missing mocks, async timing issues)
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks for fixable skipped tests

### Task 4: Document Coverage Gaps by Priority (AC: 5)
- [ ] Analyze coverage report for the 13 active services:
  - AudioRecorder
  - PersistentWhisperService
  - TextInjector
  - HotkeyManager
  - TranscriptionHistoryService
  - SystemTrayManager
  - SoundService
  - MemoryMonitor
  - ErrorLogger
  - StartupDiagnostics
  - DependencyChecker
  - ZombieProcessCleanupService
  - AudioPreprocessor
- [ ] Prioritize gaps:
  - **P0 (Critical)**: Core services (AudioRecorder, PersistentWhisperService, TextInjector) - must be ≥80%
  - **P1 (High)**: Supporting services (HotkeyManager, ErrorLogger, HistoryService) - should be ≥75%
  - **P2 (Medium)**: Utility services - nice to have ≥70%
- [ ] Create prioritized list of services needing additional tests

### Task 5: Create Baseline Coverage Report (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create `docs/qa/baseline-coverage-report.md` with:
  - Overall coverage %
  - Per-service coverage breakdown
  - List of failing tests (before/after fixes)
  - List of skipped tests with reasons
  - Prioritized gaps for future stories
  - Date/time of measurement
- [ ] Commit coverage HTML report to `VoiceLite/coverage-report/` (add to .gitignore if too large)
- [ ] Update PRD with actual coverage % (replace "Unknown %")

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Build & Deployment]

**Test Project Location**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/`
**Test Framework**: xUnit 2.9.2
**Mocking**: Moq 4.20.70
**Assertions**: FluentAssertions 6.12.0
**Coverage Tool**: Coverlet (via `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`)
**Coverage Settings**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/coverlet.runsettings`

**Current Test Stats** (as of v1.0.66):
- 217 tests exist
- Unknown % passing (need to measure)
- 1 known failing test: `MemoryLeakStressTest.ServiceDisposal_Performance_Fast`
- 14+ skipped tests (WPF UI limitations)

### Known Test Issues
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

1. **PersistentWhisperService disposal timeout**: 5s vs 500ms expected
   - Root cause: Slow whisper.exe process termination
   - Affects: `MemoryLeakStressTest.ServiceDisposal_Performance_Fast`

2. **Skipped tests**: WPF UI testing limitations
   - SystemTrayManagerTests (UI components)
   - WhisperServiceTests (subprocess timing)

3. **Flaky tests**: Async timing issues (to be identified)

### Testing Standards
[Source: CLAUDE.md#Testing]

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/VoiceLite.Tests.csproj

# Run with coverage
dotnet test VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/VoiceLite.Tests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/coverlet.runsettings
```

**Coverage Targets**:
- Overall: ≥75%
- Services/ directory: ≥80%
- Critical services (AudioRecorder, PersistentWhisperService, TextInjector): ≥80% minimum

**Test Categories**:
1. Unit Tests: Service logic, models, utilities
2. Integration Tests: Service interactions
3. UI Tests: Limited (WPF challenges)
4. Performance Tests: Memory leak detection, disposal timing

### 13 Active Services to Measure
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Service Layer]

**Core Services** (highest priority for coverage):
1. AudioRecorder - NAudio-based recording
2. PersistentWhisperService - Whisper subprocess management
3. TextInjector - Text injection via InputSimulator

**Supporting Services**:
4. HotkeyManager - Win32 hotkey registration
5. TranscriptionHistoryService - History management
6. SystemTrayManager - Tray icon/menu
7. SoundService - Audio feedback
8. ErrorLogger - File-based logging
9. MemoryMonitor - Memory tracking
10. ZombieProcessCleanupService - Orphaned process cleanup
11. StartupDiagnostics - Pre-flight checks
12. DependencyChecker - Runtime dependency verification
13. AudioPreprocessor - Audio enhancement (disabled by default)

### Performance Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Performance Characteristics]

**Known Issues Affecting Tests**:
- PersistentWhisperService disposal: 5 seconds (slow)
- First transcription: 2-3s warmup
- Test timeouts may need adjustment for realistic scenarios

### File Locations for Coverage Report

**Generated Coverage Files**:
- `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml`
- HTML report: `VoiceLite/coverage-report/index.html` (after ReportGenerator)

**Documentation Output**:
- `docs/qa/baseline-coverage-report.md` (create this)

### Success Criteria for This Story

✅ **Story is complete when**:
1. Coverage % is known and documented
2. All 217 tests either pass or are intentionally skipped with documented reasons
3. Coverage gaps are prioritized and documented
4. Baseline report exists for tracking improvement
5. PRD updated with actual coverage numbers

### Important Notes

- This is Day 1-2 priority work (from 2-week sprint plan)
- Do NOT write new tests in this story - only measure and fix existing
- Future stories (2.1.2+) will add tests to close coverage gaps
- Focus on getting accurate baseline, not achieving 80% yet

## Testing

### Test Execution
- Run full test suite with coverage enabled
- Verify all tests complete (pass or skip)
- Capture coverage metrics

### Validation
- Coverage report generates successfully
- All documented failing tests are fixed
- Baseline report is accurate and complete
