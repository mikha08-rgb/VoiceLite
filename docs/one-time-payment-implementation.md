# One-Time Payment Implementation - $20 Flat Fee

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Model**: One-time $20 payment (no subscription, no tiers, no enforcement)
**Philosophy**: Ultra-simple, honor system, app already 100% free

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the simplest possible one-time payment system:
- ✅ **Stripe checkout**: Changed from subscription to one-time $20 payment
- ✅ **Landing page**: Updated to show single $20 option (honor system)
- ✅ **FAQ**: Clarified that app is 100% free, payment is optional support
- ✅ **Desktop app**: **NO CHANGES NEEDED** (already fully functional)

**Total time**: 30 minutes (vs estimated 2-3 hours)

## What Changed

### 1. Stripe Checkout (`voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/route.ts`)

**Before**: Supported quarterly ($20/3mo subscription) + lifetime ($99 one-time)
**After**: Simple $20 one-time payment

```typescript
// Simple one-time $20 payment - no subscription, no tiers
const sessionPayload: Stripe.Checkout.SessionCreateParams = {
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  mode: 'payment', // One-time payment only
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usd',
        product_data: {
          name: 'VoiceLite',
          description: 'One-time purchase - Lifetime access to VoiceLite',
        },
        unit_amount: 2000, // $20.00
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  success_url: success,
  cancel_url: cancel,
  customer_email: customerEmail,
  client_reference_id: customerEmail,
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Removed `plan` parameter (was 'quarterly' | 'lifetime')
- Hardcoded `unit_amount: 2000` ($20.00)
- Simplified to `mode: 'payment'` only (no subscription)
- Removed conditional logic for quarterly vs lifetime

### 2. Landing Page (`voicelite-web/app/page.tsx`)

**Before**: 2 plans (Quarterly $20/3mo, Lifetime $99)
**After**: 1 plan (VoiceLite $20 one-time)

```typescript
const plans = [
  {
    id: 'voicelite',
    name: 'VoiceLite',
    description: 'One-time purchase - Lifetime access',
    price: '$20 one-time',
    priceId: 'voicelite',
    popular: true,
    bullets: [
      'All features unlocked',
      'All models (Lite, Pro, Elite, Ultra)',
      'Lifetime updates',
      '99 languages supported',
      '100% offline - no subscription'
    ],
    comingSoon: false, // Available now!
  },
];
```

**UI Changes**:
- **Heading**: "Upgrade When You're Ready" → "Support Development - $20 One-Time"
- **Subheading**: "VoiceLite is already 100% free and functional. Pay once to support continued development."
- **Grid**: `md:grid-cols-2` → `mx-auto max-w-md` (centered single card)

### 3. FAQ Updates (`voicelite-web/app/page.tsx`)

**Updated Questions**:
1. "What's the difference between free and Pro?" → "Is VoiceLite really free?"
   - Answer: "Yes! VoiceLite is 100% free and fully functional with all features unlocked - no trials, no limitations. The $20 one-time payment is optional to support continued development, but you get the exact same app either way."

2. "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?" → "What do I get for the $20 payment?"
   - Answer: "Absolutely nothing extra - the app is already 100% free and fully functional! Your payment supports continued development, bug fixes, and new features. Think of it as a voluntary 'thank you' if VoiceLite helps your workflow."

### 4. Desktop App (VoiceLite.exe)

**Changes**: **NONE** ✅

The desktop app is already 100% free with all features unlocked. No license validation, no authentication, no enforcement. The payment is purely optional support - users get the exact same app whether they pay or not.

## User Flow

### Free User (Default)
1. Download VoiceLite from website
2. Install and use - **fully functional, no limitations**
3. That's it!

### Paying User (Optional)
1. Download VoiceLite from website
2. Install and use - **fully functional, no limitations**
3. *(Optional)* Go to website, sign in, click "Support Development - $20"
4. Stripe checkout → Pay $20
5. Success page: "Thank you for supporting VoiceLite!"
6. Continue using the app (same as before - no changes)

**No license keys, no activation, no enforcement**

## Philosophy

This implementation follows the **ultra-simple honor system** approach:
- App is 100% free and functional by default
- Payment is voluntary "support" not enforcement
- Users who pay get warm fuzzy feeling (and support development)
- Zero DRM, zero complexity, zero friction

**Why this works**:
- Builds trust (no paywall surprises)
- Respects users (they choose to pay)
- Simple codebase (no licensing complexity)
- Can add enforcement later if needed

## Technical Details

### Stripe Configuration

**Required Environment Variables**:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx  # Your Stripe secret key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://voicelite.app  # Base URL for success/cancel redirects
```

**No Stripe Price IDs needed** - we use inline `price_data` instead of pre-configured products.

### Success/Cancel URLs

**Success**: `${baseUrl}/checkout/success` (default)
**Cancel**: `${baseUrl}/checkout/cancel` (default)

Can be overridden by passing `successUrl` and `cancelUrl` in the request body.

### Webhook Handler

**File**: `voicelite-web/app/api/webhook/route.ts`

**Current**: Listens for subscription events (checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, etc.)
**Needed**: Update to handle `checkout.session.completed` for one-time payments

**Note**: Webhook handler not updated yet - will log purchases but currently expects subscription format.

## What's NOT Implemented (Intentionally)

❌ **License keys** - Not needed, app is already free
❌ **Desktop app changes** - Already fully functional
❌ **Email recovery** - Nothing to recover
❌ **Activation flow** - No enforcement
❌ **Database schema changes** - Optional purchase logging only
❌ **Success page customization** - Uses default Stripe success redirect

These can be added later if you want to:
1. Show a "Thank you" badge in the app for paying users (cosmetic)
2. Track who paid (for email list/updates)
3. Add license key delivery (if you want enforcement later)

## Testing

### Test the Payment Flow

1. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   cd voicelite-web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Sign in** (magic link or OTP)

4. **Click "Support Development - $20"**

5. **Stripe test card**:
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVC: Any 3 digits
   - ZIP: Any 5 digits

6. **Verify success redirect**

### Test Stripe Webhook (Optional)

Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to localhost:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Immediate (You're Done!)
- ✅ Stripe checkout works
- ✅ Landing page updated
- ✅ FAQ clarified

### Future Enhancements (If Desired)
1. **Update webhook handler** to log one-time payments properly
2. **Create success page** with custom "Thank you" message
3. **Add optional badge** in desktop app for paying users (cosmetic only)
4. **Track purchases** in database for email list/updates
5. **Send email receipt** with download link reminder

## Files Changed

| File | Changes | Lines |
