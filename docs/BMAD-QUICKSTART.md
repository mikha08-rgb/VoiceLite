# BMAD Quickstart for VoiceLite

**Goal**: Ship production-ready v1.0 in 2 weeks using BMAD Method

---

## Setup Complete âœ…

You now have:
- âœ… **PRD**: [docs/prd.md](prd.md) - 6 epics, 2-week timeline
- âœ… **Architecture**: [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) - Technical overview
- âœ… **BMAD Core**: `.bmad-core/` configured for VoiceLite
- âœ… **217 tests** - Need to measure coverage %

---

## How to Use BMAD with Claude Code

### Step 1: Start a Story (Today!)

**First Story: Measure Test Coverage**

```
/BMad:sm *draft
```

This will create your first story in `docs/stories/`. The Scrum Master (SM) agent will:
1. Look at Epic 2.1 (Service Layer Test Coverage)
2. Create a story for measuring actual coverage %
3. Break it into tasks

### Step 2: Implement the Story

```
/BMad:dev *develop-story {story-file}
```

The Dev agent will:
1. Read the story
2. Execute tasks sequentially
3. Write tests
4. Update the story with progress

### Step 3: QA Review (Optional but Recommended)

```
/BMad:qa *review {story-file}
```

The QA agent will:
1. Check test coverage
2. Review code quality
3. Create quality gate decision
4. Suggest improvements

## Quick Tips

### 1. One Story at a Time
Don't try to do everything at once. BMAD works best with focused stories.

### 2. Use QA Early
Run `/BMad:qa *risk` and `/BMad:qa *design` BEFORE coding complex stories.

### 3. Keep Context Clean
BMAD agents load minimal context. If you switch agents, start a new conversation.

### 4. Trust the Process
The agents will guide you through the workflow. Follow the prompts.

### 5. Review Before Committing
Always review agent changes before committing to git.

## Common Workflows

### Full Story Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create story
/BMad:sm *draft

# 2. (Optional) Risk assessment
/BMad:qa *risk {story}

# 3. Implement
/BMad:dev *develop-story {story}

# 4. Review
/BMad:qa *review {story}

# 5. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: {story-title}"
```

### Quick Bug Fix
```bash
# 1. Create bug story manually in docs/stories/
# 2. Implement
/BMad:dev *develop-story {story}
# 3. Commit
```

### Just Need Code Review
```bash
/BMad:qa *review {story-file}
```

## Getting Unstuck

### "I don't know what story to create"
```
/BMad:sm *draft
```
The SM will look at the PRD and suggest the next logical story.

### "The agent is confused"
Start a new conversation. BMAD agents are stateless.

### "I need to change the PRD"
Edit [docs/prd.md](prd.md) directly. BMAD reads it fresh each time.

### "Tests are failing"
That's normal for vibe-coded projects! Use `/BMad:dev` to fix them.

---

## Next Actions

### Right Now (Day 1):
1. âœ… Review [docs/prd.md](prd.md) - Make sure 2-week plan looks good
2. âœ… Review [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) - Understand the system
3. **Start first story**: `/BMad:sm *draft`
4. **Implement it**: `/BMad:dev *develop-story {story}`

### Today's Goal:
**Measure actual test coverage %** so we know where we stand.
