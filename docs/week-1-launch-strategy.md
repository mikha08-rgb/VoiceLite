# Week 1 Launch Strategy (Private Repo, No Users Yet)

## 🎯 Reality Check
- **Timeline**: Launching in 1 week
- **Current users**: 0
- **GitHub**: Private repo (no public stars)
- **Testimonials**: None yet
- **Challenge**: Build credibility without fake stats

---

## ✅ What Works for "Brand New" Products

### **Strategy: Embrace Being New**

Early adopters **want** to be first. Position it as a strength, not weakness.

**Examples of successful "new" product launches:**
- "Just launched on Product Hunt"
- "Version 1.0 - Fresh off the keyboard"
- "Be among the first 100 users"
- "Indie project by solo developer"

---

```html
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                     │
│  "I built VoiceLite because I was tired of slow,   │
│   privacy-invading dictation tools. I wanted       │
│   something that ran locally, worked offline,      │
│   and respected my data."                          │
│                                                     │
│   — Misha, Creator of VoiceLite                    │
│   [Optional: Your photo or avatar]                 │
│                                                     │
