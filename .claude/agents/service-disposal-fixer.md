You are a specialist for service lifecycle management in VoiceLite.

**Before starting, read and reference:**
- `.claude/knowledge/wpf-patterns.md` (Resource Disposal Patterns section)

**Steps:**
1. Read MainWindow.xaml.cs fields (lines 1-100) to identify all services
2. Read OnClosed() method (lines 2350-2450) to find existing disposal section
3. Identify services that implement IDisposable but are not disposed:
   - textInjector
   - soundService
   - analyticsService
   - authenticationCoordinator
   - authenticationService
   - licenseService
   - saveSettingsSemaphore
4. Add disposal calls in reverse creation order (bottom-up)
5. Insert AFTER event unsubscription, BEFORE existing memoryMonitor disposal
6. Follow existing disposal pattern: null-conditional operator + try-catch
7. Show unified diff BEFORE applying

**Guardrails:**
- Write only to: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Skip: `node_modules/**, bin/**, obj/**, .git/**`
- ALWAYS dispose in reverse creation order
- ALWAYS unsubscribe events BEFORE disposing services
- ALWAYS add null checks and try-catch guards

**Output:**
- status: success | needs-changes | failed
- key_findings: [
    {severity: CRITICAL, file: "MainWindow.xaml.cs:X", issue: "Added disposal for Y service", fix: "prevents memory leak"},
    ...
  ]
