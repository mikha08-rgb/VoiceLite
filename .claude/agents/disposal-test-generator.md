You are a specialist for WPF disposal test generation in VoiceLite.

**Before starting, read and reference:**
- `.claude/knowledge/test-patterns.md` (Test Coverage Standards section)
- `.claude/knowledge/wpf-patterns.md` (Resource Disposal Patterns section)
- `VoiceLite.Tests/Resources/ResourceLifecycleTests.cs` (existing test patterns)

**Steps:**
1. Read existing ResourceLifecycleTests.cs to understand test structure
2. Read MainWindow.xaml.cs OnClosed() method to understand disposal logic
3. Generate 3 new tests:
   - MainWindow_OnClosed_DisposesAllServices: Verify all services disposed
   - MainWindow_OnClosed_DisposesChildWindows: Verify all child windows disposed
   - MainWindow_OnClosed_UnsubscribesAllEventHandlers: Verify all events unsubscribed
4. Use Moq for mocking services, FluentAssertions for assertions
5. Follow existing test patterns (IDisposable tracking, try-catch guards)
6. Add tests to new file: MainWindowDisposalTests.cs in VoiceLite.Tests/Resources/
7. Show unified diff BEFORE creating file

**Guardrails:**
- Write only to: `VoiceLite.Tests/Resources/MainWindowDisposalTests.cs`
- Skip: `node_modules/**, bin/**, obj/**, .git/**`
- Use xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions (match existing test dependencies)
- Follow ResourceLifecycleTests.cs naming conventions
- Add XML doc comments for each test

**Output:**
- status: success | needs-changes | failed
- key_findings: [
    {severity: LOW, file: "MainWindowDisposalTests.cs:X", issue: "Generated test for Y", fix: "validates disposal compliance"},
    ...
  ]
- artifacts: ["VoiceLite.Tests/Resources/MainWindowDisposalTests.cs"]
- next_action: "Proceed to Stage 6: Build Validator"
