### **Tier 2: Nice to Have (Set up Week 2+)**

#### 5. **Plausible Analytics** - Privacy-First Alternative
**Cost:** $9/month (or self-host for free)
**Why:** Simpler than GA4, GDPR-compliant, no cookie banner needed
**When:** If GA4 feels too complex or you want privacy focus

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install next-plausible
# Add to next.config.js
```

---

#### 6. **PostHog** - Product Analytics + Session Replay
**Cost:** FREE up to 1M events/month
**Why:** See exactly what users do (click heatmaps, session recordings)
**When:** Week 2-3, once you have steady traffic

**What it tracks:**
- User behavior flows
- Feature usage (which buttons clicked)
- Session recordings (watch users navigate)
- Funnel analysis (download ‚Üí install ‚Üí activate)

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install posthog-js

```

---

#### 7. **Mixpanel** - Event Tracking
**Cost:** FREE up to 20M events/month
**Why:** Track specific events (button clicks, feature usage)
**When:** If you need detailed event tracking beyond GA4

**Example events:**
- "Download button clicked"
- "License activated"
- "Model downloaded" (which model)

---

### **Desktop App Analytics (Optional)**

#### Option A: Custom Telemetry (Privacy-Friendly)
**Recommendation:** Add minimal, privacy-respecting telemetry

**What to track:**
- App version (1.0.88)
- Model used (tiny, small, etc.)
- Transcription count (daily aggregate, no content)
- Error events (crashes)

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// In desktop app, send anonymous events to your API
POST /api/telemetry
{
  "event": "app_started",
  "version": "1.0.88",
  "model": "tiny",
  "anonymousId": "hashed-device-id"  // No PII
}
```

**Privacy:** Fully transparent in README (users can audit code)

#### Option B: No Desktop Telemetry (Privacy-First)
**Recommendation for launch:** Don't add desktop analytics yet

**Why:**
- You already have web analytics (downloads, conversions)
- VoiceLite's selling point is privacy (offline, no tracking)
- Adding telemetry may hurt trust with privacy-conscious users
- Can add later if users request it (opt-in)

**What you'll miss:** Can't track active users, feature usage, crashes

**Workaround:** Use license activations as proxy for active users
