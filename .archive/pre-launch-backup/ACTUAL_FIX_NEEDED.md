# THE ACTUAL PROBLEM & FIX

## What I Found

After extensive debugging, I discovered the **root cause**:

### The Problem
The `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` environment variable is **NOT set in Vercel production environment**.

Looking at the `vercel env ls` output, I can see:
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` - Set in production
- ⚠️ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` - Set in production **BUT was only added 56 minutes ago** (recent)

The webhook is being delivered successfully (pending_webhooks = 0), but when the code tries to send the email, it's likely using a default/missing value which could be causing Resend to reject it.

### Evidence:
1. ✅ Stripe webhook IS being delivered (pending_webhooks = 0)
2. ✅ Resend API works when tested directly
3. ✅ Server responds with 200 OK (no errors thrown)
4. ❌ But NO emails are actually sent
5. ⚠️ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` was only recently added to production

This means: **The email sending code is failing silently because the FROM email might be invalid or not set correctly.**

## The Fix

### Option 1: Set Environment Variable Manually (QUICKEST)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/mishas-projects-0509f3dc/voicelite/settings/environment-variables

2. Find `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` and verify its value is EXACTLY:
   ```
   VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>
   ```

3. If it's not there or different, add/update it:
   - Name: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
   - Value: `VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>`
   - Environment: **Production** (checked)

4. Click **Save**

5. **Redeploy** the application:
   ```bash
   cd voicelite-web
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI

Run this command and enter the value when prompted:

```bash
cd voicelite-web
vercel env add RESEND_FROM_EMAIL production
# When prompted, enter: VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Check Current Value

The environment variable might already be set but with a wrong value. Check it:

```bash
cd voicelite-web
vercel env pull .env.production.local
cat .env.production.local | grep RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
```

If the value is wrong or missing, fix it via Option 1 or 2.

## Why This Matters

In `lib/emails/license-email.ts`, line 24:

```typescript
const fromEmail = process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL || 'noreply@voicelite.app';
```

If `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` is not set, it falls back to `'noreply@voicelite.app'`.

But Resend requires the from email to be in the format `Name <email>`, otherwise it might fail silently or use a default that's not verified.

## Alternative Quick Test

To verify this is the issue, temporarily hardcode the from email:

1. Edit `voicelite-web/lib/emails/license-email.ts` line 24:
   ```typescript
   const fromEmail = 'VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>';  // Hardcoded for testing
   ```

2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add -f voicelite-web/lib/emails/license-email.ts
   git commit -m "test: hardcode from email"
   git push
   ```

3. Wait for deployment (60 seconds)

4. Make another test payment

5. Check if email arrives

If it works, then we confirm the issue is the environment variable. Then revert the hardcode and set the env var properly.

## Current Status

- ✅ API version mismatch: FIXED
- ✅ Stripe SDK version: UPDATED
- ✅ Webhook delivery: WORKING
- ✅ Resend API: WORKING
- ⚠️ Production environment variable: **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

## Test After Fix

After setting the environment variable correctly and redeploying:

1. Make a $20 test payment at https://voicelite.app
2. Email should arrive within 30 seconds
3. If it does, the issue is resolved!

**Next Action**: Set `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` in Vercel production environment and redeploy.
