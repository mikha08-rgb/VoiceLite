# ‚úÖ License Email Fix - Successfully Deployed

## Summary
Fixed the critical bug preventing license emails from being sent after payment.

## Root Cause
Stripe checkout sessions were not creating Customer records, causing the webhook handler to fail when trying to access `session.customer`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Main Fix: Customer Creation** (Commit `bad4d98`)
**File:** `voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/route.ts`
```typescript
customer_creation: 'always', // CRITICAL: Create customer so webhook can access customer ID
```

### 2. **TypeScript Fix: LicenseStatus Enum** (Commit `663dfa6`)
**File:** `voicelite-web/app/api/licenses/resend-email/route.ts`
```typescript
import { LicenseStatus } from '@prisma/client';
// Changed from: license.status !== 'active'
// To: license.status !== LicenseStatus.ACTIVE
```

### 3. **Build Fix: Exclude Scripts** (Commit `e0ccff3`)
**File:** `voicelite-web/tsconfig.json`
```json
"exclude": ["node_modules", "scripts"]
```

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Build Succeeded** - All TypeScript errors resolved
‚úÖ **Pushed to GitHub** - Commits: `bad4d98`, `663dfa6`, `e0ccff3`
‚úÖ **Vercel Deployment** - Build completed successfully

## Production URL

Your main domain `voicelite.app` should auto-deploy from GitHub. Check:
- https://vercel.com/mishas-projects-0509f3dc/voicelite

Or you deployed to alternate project:
- https://voicelite-g66lq7gje-mishas-projects-0509f3dc.vercel.app

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Make a Test Payment
1. Go to https://voicelite.app
2. Click "Get Pro"
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete checkout

### 2. Verify Email Arrives
- Email should arrive within 30 seconds
- Contains license key in large blue box
- From: VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>
- Subject: "Your VoiceLite Pro License Key"

### 3. Check Stripe Webhook
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click your webhook endpoint
3. Check latest `checkout.session.completed` event
4. Should show **200 response** (success)
5. Response body: `{"received":true,"eventId":"evt_..."}`

### 4. Check Vercel Logs (if needed)
```bash
vercel logs --limit 50
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `üìß Attempting to send license email to [email]`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ License email sent successfully to [email] (MessageID: [id])`

## What Was Wrong Before

### Issue 1: No Customer ID
```
Stripe Event Data:
Customer ID: N/A ‚ùå  // This was null!
Customer Email: mikhail.lev08@gmail.com
Payment Intent: pi_xxx
```

**Webhook Handler Expected:**
```typescript
const stripeCustomerId = (session.customer as string) ?? '';
if (!email || !stripeCustomerId) {
  throw new Error('Missing customer email or ID'); // ‚ùå Failed here
}
```

### Issue 2: Webhook Failed Silently
- Webhook received event
- Tried to process checkout
- Threw error: "Missing customer email or ID"
- **Email was never sent**
- Payment succeeded, but customer got no license key

## What's Fixed Now

### Customer Creation
```typescript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'payment',
  // ... other settings
  customer_creation: 'always', // ‚úÖ Now creates customer!
});
```

### Webhook Flow (Now Working)
1. ‚úÖ Payment completes
2. ‚úÖ Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` event
3. ‚úÖ Webhook receives event with **customer ID present**
4. ‚úÖ Creates license record in database
5. ‚úÖ Sends email via Resend API
6. ‚úÖ Records `email_sent` event
7. ‚úÖ Customer receives license key

## Database Records (After Fix)

```
License:
  id: xxx
  email: customer@email.com
  licenseKey: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
  stripeCustomerId: cus_XXXXXXXX  ‚úÖ Now present!
  stripePaymentIntentId: pi_XXXXXXXX
  status: ACTIVE

LicenseEvent:
  eventType: email_sent  ‚úÖ Success!
  metadata: { messageId: "xxx", email: "customer@email.com" }
```

## Monitoring

### Check Recent Purchases
Run the diagnostic script:
```bash
node check-stripe-webhook.js
```

This shows:
- Recent `checkout.session.completed` events
- Customer IDs (should no longer be N/A)
- Webhook endpoint configuration

### Manual Email Resend (if needed)
For customers who paid before this fix, you can manually resend:
```bash
POST https://voicelite.app/api/licenses/resend-email
Body: { "email": "customer@email.com" }
```

## Files Changed

1. `voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/route.ts` - Added `customer_creation: 'always'`
2. `voicelite-web/app/api/licenses/resend-email/route.ts` - Fixed TypeScript enum
3. `voicelite-web/tsconfig.json` - Excluded scripts from build

## Commits

- `bad4d98` - fix: add customer_creation to checkout for license emails
- `663dfa6` - fix: use LicenseStatus enum instead of string literal
- `e0ccff3` - fix: exclude scripts folder from TypeScript build

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED AND DEPLOYED
**Next Action:** Test a payment and verify email arrives
