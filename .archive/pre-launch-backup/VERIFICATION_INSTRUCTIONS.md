# How to Verify the Email Fix Is Working

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed
- **Problem**: API version mismatch between Stripe SDK (2025-08-27.basil) and webhook endpoint (2025-09-30.clover)
- **Solution**: Updated all files to use API version 2025-09-30.clover + upgraded Stripe SDK to v19.1.0
- **Status**: Deployed to production

## üß™ Testing Options

### Option 1: Make a Real Test Payment (Recommended)
This is the most reliable way to verify the complete flow.

1. **Create a checkout session**:
   ```bash
   node test-live-payment-flow.js
   ```

2. **Complete the payment** with a real card (you can refund it later)

3. **Check your email** within 30 seconds

4. **Expected result**: You receive an email with subject "Your VoiceLite Pro License Key"

---

### Option 2: Send Test Webhook from Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to **Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

2. Find your webhook endpoint: `https://voicelite.app/api/webhook`

3. Click on it, then click **"Send test webhook"**

4. Select event type: `checkout.session.completed`

5. Click **"Send test event"**

6. **Expected result**:
   - Webhook receives 200 OK response
   - Email is sent (check logs at https://dashboard.resend.com)

---

### Option 3: Use Stripe CLI (Advanced)

1. **Install Stripe CLI**: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

2. **Login**:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Trigger a test event**:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```

4. **Forward to local**:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to https://voicelite.app/api/webhook
   ```

## üìä Monitoring & Verification

### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
# Get latest deployment
cd voicelite-web
vercel ls

# View logs (replace with actual deployment URL)
vercel logs https://voicelite-7qxhxk79i-mishas-projects-0509f3dc.vercel.app
```

Look for these log messages:
```
üìß Attempting to send license email to [email] (License: [key])
‚úÖ License email sent successfully to [email] (MessageID: [id])
```

### Check Resend Dashboard
https://resend.com/emails

Look for:
- Recent email sends
- Delivery status
- Open/click tracking

### Check Stripe Dashboard
https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/we_1SJn8RB71coZaXSZ2puqCp2T

Look for:
- Recent webhook deliveries
- Success/failure status
- Response codes (should be 200)

## üîç Current Status

**Deployment**: ‚úÖ Live in production (2 minutes ago)
**API Health**: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
**Webhook Endpoint**: ‚úÖ Accessible (returns 400 for invalid signature as expected)
**API Version**: ‚úÖ Now matches Stripe configuration (2025-09-30.clover)
**Email Service**: ‚úÖ Resend is working (last email sent 67 minutes ago)

---

## üéØ Quick Verification (Simplest Method)

**Just make a $20 payment yourself**:

1. Go to https://voicelite.app
2. Click "Get Pro"
3. Complete payment with your card
4. Check your email inbox

Within 30 seconds, you should receive your license key. If you do, the fix is confirmed working!

You can then refund the payment in Stripe Dashboard if needed:
https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments

---

## ‚ùì What If Email Still Doesn't Arrive?

If you test and the email still doesn't come:

1. **Check Stripe webhook logs** to see if webhook was received (200 OK)
2. **Check Resend dashboard** to see if email was sent
3. **Check spam folder** in your email
4. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for any errors

If issues persist, we'll need to investigate further, but the API version mismatch (the root cause) is now fixed.
