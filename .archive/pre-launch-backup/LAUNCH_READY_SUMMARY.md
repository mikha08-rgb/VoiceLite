## Pre-Launch Checklist (Do This Now!)

### 1. Cleanup Repository (5 min)
```bash
bash cleanup-pre-launch.sh
git add .
git commit -m "chore: clean up debugging files for v1.0.88 release"
git push origin master
```

**What this removes:**
- 19 debugging markdown files (ACTUAL_FIX_NEEDED.md, etc.)
- 30+ temporary test scripts (check-*.js, test-*.js, etc.)
- Root node_modules/ and package.json (only needed in voicelite-web/)

**What this keeps:**
- README.md (landing page)
- CLAUDE.md (dev guide)
- CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md
- All new launch planning docs

### 2. Verify Systems (10 min)
```bash
bash verify-release-ready.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
Passed: 12
Failed: 0
🚀 ALL CHECKS PASSED - READY FOR LAUNCH!
```

If any failures, fix them before proceeding.

### 3. Test End-to-End Flow (30 min)
Follow [DAY_1_CHECKLIST.md](DAY_1_CHECKLIST.md) "End-to-End Test" section:
- [ ] Desktop app transcription works
- [ ] Payment flow completes
- [ ] License email arrives
- [ ] Pro license activates
- [ ] Pro models downloadable

### 4. Create GitHub Release (10 min)
```bash
git tag v1.0.88

## What Makes This Launch "Lean"

### Philosophy:
Launch with **minimal viable product**, validate market fit, iterate based on feedback.

### What's Included:
- ✅ Core functionality (voice typing)
- ✅ Free tier (Tiny model)
- ✅ Pro tier ($20) with 4 advanced models
- ✅ License system working
- ✅ Basic documentation
- ✅ Open source & auditable

### What's NOT Included (Yet):
- ❌ Voice commands ("new line", "period")
- ❌ Custom dictionary
- ❌ Voice shortcuts
- ❌ Export history
- ❌ Real-time streaming
- ❌ Linux/Mac versions

**These features will be added based on user feedback!**

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Manageable):
- False positive antivirus warnings → Expected, documented in FAQ
- Installation issues with VC++ Runtime → Bundled in installer
- Some users need help activating license → /api/licenses/resend-email endpoint ready

### Medium Risk (Monitor Closely):
- Payment flow fails in production → Tested, but monitor Stripe/Resend dashboards
- High traffic crashes Vercel → Unlikely on free tier, but monitor analytics
- Negative feedback on accuracy → Recommend Pro tier upgrade

### High Risk (Emergency Plan Ready):
- Critical bug discovered after launch → Hot deploy web, rebuild desktop if needed
- License emails stop sending → Resend API backup, manual sends possible
- GitHub Actions fails to build installer → Manual build with Inno Setup

---

## Emergency Contacts & Resources

### Monitoring Dashboards:
- **Vercel:** https://vercel.com/dashboard (web deployment)
- **Stripe:** https://dashboard.stripe.com (payments)
- **Resend:** https://resend.com/dashboard (emails)

# Manually send license email
curl -X POST https://voicelite.app/api/licenses/resend-email \
