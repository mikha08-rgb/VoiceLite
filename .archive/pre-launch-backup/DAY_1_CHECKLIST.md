  ```
  Title: VoiceLite - Voice Typing for Windows (100% Offline, Free + Pro Tiers)

  Hey r/SideProject! After 3 months of development, I'm launching VoiceLite.

  **What it does:**
  Voice typing in ANY Windows app. Hold Shift+Z, speak, release - text appears.

  **Why I built it:**
  Frustrated with Windows Speech (poor tech term recognition) and Dragon ($200+).
  Wanted something that works everywhere, offline, privacy-first.

  **Tech Stack:**
  - Desktop: C# + WPF + .NET 8
  - AI: OpenAI Whisper (whisper.cpp)
  - Backend: Next.js 15 + Prisma + PostgreSQL
  - Payment: Stripe

  **Business Model:**
  - Free: Tiny model (80-85% accuracy), unlimited usage
  - Pro ($20 one-time): 4 advanced models (85-98% accuracy)

  **Download:** [GitHub link]

  Would love your feedback! What features would you add?
  ```
- [ ] Post to r/Windows (simplified version)
- [ ] Post to r/programming (technical focus)

**Hacker News:**
- [ ] Submit "Show HN" post:
  ```
  Title: Show HN: VoiceLite - Voice Typing for Windows (100% Offline)
  URL: [GitHub link]

  Hi HN! I built VoiceLite - a privacy-first voice typing tool for Windows.

  Key features:
  - Works in ANY application (even games, terminals)
  - 100% offline (powered by OpenAI Whisper)
  - Free tier + $20 Pro tier (one-time payment)
  - Open source & auditable
  - Q8_0 quantization for 67% faster inference

  Technical challenges:
  - Global hotkey handling across all Windows apps
  - Process management for whisper.cpp (C++ ‚Üí C# interop)
  - Smart text injection (clipboard vs typing vs paste)
  - Model optimization (Q8_0 quantization, flash attention)

  Built in 3 months. Would love your feedback!
