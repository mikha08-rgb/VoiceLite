## How to Test End-to-End

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)
1. Open: https://voicelite.app
2. Click "Get Pro" (or "Upgrade" button)
3. In Stripe checkout:
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - Email: **Use YOUR real email** (mikhail.lev08@gmail.com)
4. Complete payment
5. **Check email within 30 seconds** - should receive license key

### Option 2: Use Pre-Generated Test Link
I created a test checkout session for you:
```
https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_live_a1yUDOeD6W6G76QIEj9JW8AQciORoqPRElbLAg0XP9IawSiqpkAiYDYEFE
```

1. Open the link above
2. Complete payment with test card
3. Check email: test@example.com (won't work - it's fake)
   - **Better:** Enter your real email in the form

### Option 3: Check Recent Paid Sessions
Run this script to see if new payments create customers:
```bash
node check-stripe-webhook.js
```

Look for recent checkout sessions and verify:
- `Customer ID: cus_XXX` (not NULL) ‚úÖ
- `Customer Creation: always` ‚úÖ

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
1. **Email arrives** with subject "Your VoiceLite Pro License Key"
2. **From:** VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>
3. **Contains:** License key in large blue box
4. **Stripe Dashboard:** Event shows 200 response
5. **Vercel Logs:** Show "‚úÖ License email sent successfully"

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators (Should NOT happen now)
1. No email arrives after 2 minutes
2. Stripe webhook shows 500 error
3. Vercel logs show "Missing customer email or ID"
4. Customer ID is NULL in checkout session

## Verification Checklist

- [x] `customer_creation: 'always'` in checkout code
- [x] TypeScript build passes
- [x] Webhook endpoint accessible
- [x] Email service functional
- [x] Test sessions create with customer_creation enabled
- [ ] **Final test: Real payment confirms email delivery** ‚Üê DO THIS NOW

## Monitoring

### Check Stripe Events
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events
2. Filter: `checkout.session.completed`
3. Click latest event
4. Check "Webhook attempts" tab
5. Should show: **200 response** (success)

### Check Vercel Logs
```bash
cd voicelite-web
vercel logs --limit 50
```

Look for:
- `üìß Attempting to send license email to [email]`
- `‚úÖ License email sent successfully to [email]`

### Check Webhook Delivery
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click: `https://voicelite.app/api/webhook`
3. View recent events
4. Successful events show green checkmark

## If Email Still Doesn't Arrive

### 1. Check Spam Folder
- From: VoiceLite <noreply@voicelite.app>
- Subject: "Your VoiceLite Pro License Key"

### 2. Verify Webhook Fired
```bash
node check-stripe-webhook.js
```

Check if latest event has customer ID.

### 3. Check Vercel Logs
Look for errors in webhook function.

### 4. Manual Resend (Last Resort)
```bash
curl -X POST https://voicelite.app/api/licenses/resend-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-email@example.com"}'
```
