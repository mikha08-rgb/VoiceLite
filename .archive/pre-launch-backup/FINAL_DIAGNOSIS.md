# Final Diagnosis & Solution

## Summary

I've been debugging your license email issue for the past hour. Here's what I've discovered:

### What Works ✅
1. ✅ **Stripe webhooks ARE being delivered** (pending_webhooks = 0)
2. ✅ **Resend API works perfectly** (I just sent you a test email successfully!)
3. ✅ **Email sending code works** (verified by manual test)
4. ✅ **API version mismatch fixed** (2025-09-30.clover everywhere)
5. ✅ **Stripe SDK updated** (v19.1.0)

### The Actual Problem ❌

The webhook handler is **catching errors and returning 200 OK to Stripe**, making Stripe think it succeeded, but the actual error is being silently swallowed.

Looking at the code (line 84-88 in webhook/route.ts):
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Webhook processing failure', error);
  // Return 200 to avoid Stripe retries for permanent failures
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Processing error', eventId: event.id }, { status: 200 });
}
```

This means:
- Stripe sends webhook → Your server receives it
- Something fails (likely database connection or license creation)
- Error is caught and logged
- Server returns 200 OK to Stripe
- Stripe thinks it succeeded (pending_webhooks = 0)
- But NO email was sent because the code never reached that point

### Most Likely Root Cause

**Database connection is failing** when trying to create the license record.

Possible reasons:
1. DATABASE_URL environment variable not set correctly in Vercel production
2. Prisma client not initialized properly
3. Database connection timeout
4. Missing unique constraints in database

### What I've Done

1. ✅ Fixed API version mismatch
2. ✅ Updated Stripe SDK
3. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to webhook handler
4. ✅ Deployed latest version with detailed error logging

### Next Steps (NO PAYMENT NEEDED)

The latest deployment has extensive logging. To see the ACTUAL error:

**Option 1: Check Vercel Logs**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/mishas-projects-0509f3dc/voicelite/deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment (voicelite-o5w33wmzl or newer)
3. Click "Runtime Logs"
4. Look for recent webhook calls - you'll see the detailed error logs

**Option 2: Use Stripe Dashboard to Resend Webhook**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Find webhook endpoint: https://voicelite.app/api/webhook
3. Click on it
4. Find one of the recent failed events
5. Click "Resend"
6. Check Vercel logs to see the detailed error output

**Option 3: Check Database Directly**
Run this to verify database connection:
```bash
cd voicelite-web
npx prisma studio
```

If it connects, the database is fine. If not, DATABASE_URL is wrong.

### Expected Log Output

With the new logging, you should see either:

**Success case:**
```
🔔 WEBHOOK RECEIVED: checkout.session.completed - Session cs_live_xxx
📝 Email: user@example.com, Customer: cus_xxx
💳 Plan type: lifetime, Mode: payment
💰 Processing lifetime/one-time payment
💳 Payment Intent ID: pi_xxx
💾 Creating/updating license in database...
✅ License created: VL-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX (ID: 123)
📧 Attempting to send license email...
✅ License email sent successfully
```

**Failure case (what we'll see):**
```
🔔 WEBHOOK RECEIVED: checkout.session.completed - Session cs_live_xxx
📝 Email: user@example.com, Customer: cus_xxx
💳 Plan type: lifetime, Mode: payment
💰 Processing lifetime/one-time payment
💳 Payment Intent ID: pi_xxx
💾 Creating/updating license in database...
❌ DATABASE ERROR: [actual error here]
```

### Your Test Email

**Check your inbox (mikhail.lev08@gmail.com)** - I sent you a test email 2 minutes ago with subject "DIAGNOSTIC: Testing Resend API" and a fake license key. If you got it, that confirms email delivery works!

### To Fix Without Spending More Money

1. Check Vercel runtime logs for the actual database error
2. OR manually check DATABASE_URL env var is set correctly
3. OR try running `npx prisma studio` in voicelite-web to test DB connection

Once we see the actual error in the logs, I can fix it immediately.

**Status**: Diagnostic logging deployed. Ready to see actual error without requiring new payments.
