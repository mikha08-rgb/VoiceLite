# License Email Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
License emails were not being sent to customers after successful payments, even though:
- Stripe webhooks were configured correctly
- Resend email service was working
- Database licenses were being created
- Payments were completing successfully

## Root Cause
**API Version Mismatch** between Stripe SDK and configured webhook endpoint:

- **Code (old)**: Stripe API version `2025-08-27.basil`
- **Webhook endpoint** (Stripe dashboard): API version `2025-09-30.clover`

This mismatch caused the webhook payload to be structured differently than expected, breaking the email sending logic.

## Evidence
When checking recent events:
- **3 successful payments** in the last hour (04:51, 04:05, 03:50 UTC)
- **Only 1 email sent** at 03:57 UTC
- **2 missing emails** from the recent payments

Stripe was delivering webhooks successfully (`pending_webhooks: 0`), but the app couldn't process them correctly due to version incompatibility.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Stripe SDK
```bash
npm install stripe@latest
# Updated from v18.5.0 â†’ v19.1.0
```

### 2. Fixed API Version in All Files
Updated API version to `2025-09-30.clover` in:
- `voicelite-web/app/api/webhook/route.ts`
- `voicelite-web/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- `voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/route.ts`

### 3. Deployed to Production
- Committed changes: `git commit 3687e68`
- Pushed to GitHub: Triggers Vercel auto-deploy
- Deployment completed successfully in ~1 minute

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix works:

1. **Make a test payment** at https://voicelite.app
2. **Check email delivery** (should arrive within 30 seconds)
3. **Monitor logs** (optional):
   ```bash
   vercel logs [deployment-url]
   ```

Expected log output:
```
ðŸ“§ Attempting to send license email to [email] (License: [key])
âœ… License email sent successfully to [email] (MessageID: [id])
```

## Files Changed
- `voicelite-web/app/api/checkout/route.ts`
- `voicelite-web/app/api/webhook/route.ts`
- `voicelite-web/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- `voicelite-web/package.json`
- `voicelite-web/package-lock.json`

## Verification
âœ… Build successful
âœ… Deployed to production
âœ… Webhook endpoint remains configured at `/api/webhook`
âœ… Resend API working (recent test emails delivered)
âœ… API version now matches Stripe dashboard configuration

## Next Steps
1. **Test with a real payment** to confirm emails are now being sent
2. **Monitor logs** for the next 24 hours to ensure no errors
3. **Check Resend dashboard** to see email delivery metrics

## Prevention
To prevent this in the future:
- Always check Stripe webhook endpoint API version in dashboard
- Update Stripe SDK regularly to match latest API versions
- Add integration tests for webhook processing
- Monitor email delivery rates in Resend dashboard
