# 🎉 VoiceLite is READY FOR FREE RELEASE!

## ✅ Everything Built & Verified

### 1. Application Quality
- Audio capture, hotkeys, and transcription workflows pass regression tests
- Settings persist to `%APPDATA%/VoiceLite/settings.json`
- Model validation gracefully falls back to bundled tiny model
- Medium model download button tested end-to-end

### 2. Packaging & Distribution
- `dotnet publish` artifacts ready in `VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/`
- Inno Setup script (`VoiceLite/VoiceLite.iss`) compiles installer without license prompts
- Portable zip (optional) prepared for power users

### 3. Documentation
- Root `README.md` and `VoiceLite/README.md` updated with “Free Forever” messaging
- `GO_LIVE_NOW.md`, `LAUNCH_PLAN.md`, `LAUNCH_EXECUTION.md` aligned with free rollout
- FAQ covers install, model downloads, microphone permissions, and troubleshooting

### 4. Trust & Security
- Optional code signing in place or documented for future
- Installer EULA references free usage rights
- No outbound calls for license validation; app operates fully offline
