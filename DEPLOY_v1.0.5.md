**Problem:** App failed on first launch for non-admin users
- Settings couldn't be saved (Program Files is protected)
- No error logs created for debugging
- Silent failures caused user confusion

**Solution:**
- âœ… Moved settings to %APPDATA%\VoiceLite\settings.json
- âœ… Moved logs to %APPDATA%\VoiceLite\logs\voicelite.log
- âœ… Automatic directory creation on first run
- âœ… Settings migration from old location
- âœ… Improved error messages

**Upgrade Required:** All users should upgrade to v1.0.5 immediately to avoid first-run issues.
