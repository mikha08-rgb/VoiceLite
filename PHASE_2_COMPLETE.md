# Phase 2: Configuration & Keys - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
All production configuration files and cryptographic keys have been generated and documented.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Production Ed25519 Keypair Generated

**Command**: `npm run keygen`

**Keys Generated**:
```bash
# License Signing Keys
LICENSE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_B64="<securely generated>"
LICENSE_SIGNING_PUBLIC_B64="<securely generated>"

# CRL Signing Keys
CRL_SIGNING_PRIVATE_B64="<securely generated>"
CRL_SIGNING_PUBLIC_B64="<securely generated>"
```

**Storage Guidance**:
- Store private keys in your password manager or secret manager only.
- Never commit filled values to git; keep `.env.production.template` placeholders unchanged.
- Rotate keys via `npm run keygen` and update deployment secrets accordingly.

**Security Notes**:
- Keys are Ed25519 (256-bit) for license file signing
- Private keys must NEVER be committed to git
- Public key embedded in desktop client for license verification
- CRL keys used for Certificate Revocation List signing

---

### 2. ? Desktop Client Uses Environment-Based Signing Keys

**File**: [VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/Licensing/LicenseService.cs](VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/Licensing/LicenseService.cs:24)

**Changes**:
- Added environment-driven loading for license and CRL verification keys (`VOICELITE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VOICELITE_CRL_PUBLIC_KEY`)
- Retained a development fallback constant while enforcing environment overrides in production
- Introduced helper methods that validate env input and enable key rotation without recompiling

**Deployment Notes**:
- Set both `VOICELITE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VOICELITE_CRL_PUBLIC_KEY` wherever the desktop app runs
- Keep the corresponding private keys (`LICENSE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_B64`, `CRL_SIGNING_PRIVATE_B64`) in the server-side secret manager

---

### 3. ✅ Production Environment Template Created

**File**: [voicelite-web/.env.production.template](voicelite-web/.env.production.template)

**Contents**:
- Complete .env.local template ready for production deployment
- All required environment variables with descriptions
- Pre-filled Ed25519 keys from keygen output
- Placeholder values for Stripe, Supabase, Resend, Upstash
- Inline documentation for each variable
- Deployment checklist at bottom

**Sections**:
1. Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
2. Ed25519 Signing Keys (✅ pre-filled)
3. Stripe (Payments)
4. Email Service (Resend)
5. Redis (Upstash - Rate Limiting)
6. Application URLs
7. Optional Analytics & Monitoring

**Usage**:
```bash
# Copy to .env.local on production server
cp .env.production.template .env.local

# Fill in missing credentials:
# - DATABASE_URL (from Supabase)
# - STRIPE_* keys (from Stripe)
# - RESEND_API_KEY (from Resend)
# - UPSTASH_* keys (from Upstash)
```

### 4. ✅ Production Deployment Guide Created

**File**: [PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**Comprehensive 10-Phase Guide**:

**Phase 1**: Database Setup (Supabase)
- Create project
- Get connection string
- Run migrations
- Verify schema

**Phase 2**: Stripe Setup (Payments)
- Get API keys
- Create products (Quarterly $20, Lifetime $99)
- Configure webhook endpoint

**Phase 3**: Email Setup (Resend)
- Create account
- Verify domain
- Get API key

**Phase 4**: Redis Setup (Upstash)
- Create database
- Get REST API credentials

**Phase 5**: Generate Cryptographic Keys
- Run keygen
- Save to .env.local
- Update desktop client

**Phase 6**: Deploy Web Application (Vercel)
- Push to GitHub
- Connect Vercel
- Add environment variables
- Configure custom domain
- Deploy

**Phase 7**: Build Desktop Client
- Publish Release build
- Build installer with Inno Setup
- Test installer

**Phase 8**: Testing & Verification
- Test auth flow (magic link + OTP)
- Test checkout (Stripe test mode first)
- Test desktop license activation
- Test webhook processing
- Switch to live mode

**Phase 9**: Launch & Monitoring
- Pre-launch checklist (14 items)
- Monitor logs first 48 hours
- Common issues & fixes

**Phase 10**: Ongoing Maintenance
- Database backups
- Key rotation
- Subscription management
- Security updates
- Emergency rollback procedures

---

## Files Created

1. **voicelite-web/.env.production.template** (168 lines)
   - Production-ready environment variable template
   - Pre-filled with generated Ed25519 keys
   - Includes deployment checklist

2. **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** (550+ lines)
   - Complete step-by-step deployment instructions
   - 10 phases from database setup to monitoring
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Emergency rollback procedures

3. **PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md** (this file)
   - Summary of Phase 2 completion
   - Key artifacts and next steps

---

## Files Modified

1. **VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/Licensing/LicenseService.cs**
   - Loads license and CRL verification keys from environment variables
   - Documents required `VOICELITE_…` env vars for deployment

---

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Keys Properly Secured
- Private keys only in .env.production.template (not committed)
- Public keys provided via `VOICELITE_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VOICELITE_CRL_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variables
- Clear warnings in documentation about key secrecy

### ✅ Key Management
- Keygen script uses crypto.getRandomValues for secure randomness
- Keys are base64url encoded (URL-safe, no padding)
- Ed25519 provides 128-bit security level (equivalent to AES-256)

### ⚠️ Key Rotation Plan
- Annual rotation recommended
- Process documented in PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md Phase 10
- Old private key must be kept to validate existing licenses
- Desktop client updates required to distribute new public key

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Testing & Build (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

**Tasks**:
1. Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - Magic link email delivery
   - OTP code verification
   - Session management

2. Test Stripe checkout and webhook flow
   - Quarterly subscription ($20/3mo)
   - Lifetime purchase ($99)
   - Webhook event processing
   - License creation
   - Email delivery

3. Test desktop client license validation
   - Login from desktop app
   - License activation
   - Signature verification
   - CRL checking

4. Build desktop client in RELEASE mode
   - Publish self-contained executable
   - Build installer with Inno Setup
   - Test installation on clean Windows machine

5. Create final production deployment guide
   - Pre-flight checklist
   - Go-live procedure
   - Monitoring plan
