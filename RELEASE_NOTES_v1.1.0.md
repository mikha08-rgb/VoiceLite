## üîß Technical Changes

### Architecture (Week 2 Refactoring)

#### New Layers
1. **Presentation Layer** (`ViewModels/`)
   - `MainViewModel`: UI state management
   - `SettingsViewModel`: Settings UI logic
   - MVVM pattern with `INotifyPropertyChanged`

2. **Controllers Layer** (`Controllers/`)
   - `RecordingController`: Orchestrates recording operations
   - `TranscriptionController`: Manages transcription pipeline
   - Coordinates between Services and ViewModels

3. **Services Layer** (Refactored)
   - `AudioRecorder`: NAudio-based recording
   - `PersistentWhisperService`: Whisper.cpp integration
   - `TextInjector`: SmartAuto injection mode
   - `HotkeyManager`: Global hotkey registration
   - `LicenseService`: Pro license validation
   - `ProFeatureService`: Pro feature gating
   - `TranscriptionHistoryService`: History management
   - `ErrorLogger`: Centralized logging

4. **Dependency Injection** (`App.xaml.cs`)
   - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection container
   - Singleton services for app-wide state
   - Transient controllers for operations

### Performance Optimizations

#### Whisper Command-Line (v1.0.85-88)
```bash
whisper.exe -m [model] -f [audio.wav] \
  --no-timestamps --language en \
  --beam-size 1 --best-of 1 \
  --entropy-thold 3.0 --no-fallback \
  --max-context 64 --flash-attn
```

**Changes**:
- `--beam-size 1`: Greedy decoding (faster, minimal accuracy loss)
- `--entropy-thold 3.0`: Optimal threshold for speed
- `--no-fallback`: Skip fallback logic
- `--flash-attn`: Use flash attention (v1.0.87+)

#### Model Quantization (v1.0.88)
All models now use **Q8_0 quantization** (8-bit integer):
- **Tiny**: 75MB ‚Üí 42MB (45% reduction)
- **Base**: 142MB ‚Üí 78MB (45% reduction)
- **Small**: 466MB ‚Üí 253MB (46% reduction)
- **Large**: 3.09GB ‚Üí 1.6GB (48% reduction)

**Accuracy**: 99.98% identical to F16 (research-proven, arXiv 2503.09905)

### Testing Infrastructure

#### Automated Tests (184 total)
- **Services**: 60+ tests (disposal, resource cleanup, error handling)
- **Controllers**: 30+ tests (orchestration logic, retry policies)
- **ViewModels**: 20+ tests (UI state management)
- **Integration**: 25+ tests (end-to-end pipelines)
- **Resilience**: 15+ tests (retry policies, error recovery)
- **Stress**: 10+ tests (memory, concurrent operations)

#### Test Coverage
- **Services/**: ~85% (high coverage)
- **Controllers/**: ~75%
- **ViewModels/**: ~60% (WPF testing limitations)
- **Overall**: 77% (target: ‚â•75%)

**Known Issues**: WPF Dispatcher null in unit tests (technical debt for v1.2.0)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes (v1.0.94-96)
1. **v1.0.96**: Model file missing from git - `ggml-tiny.bin` was ignored by `.gitignore`, causing 100% failure rate on GitHub Actions builds. Fixed by force-adding model to git.
2. **v1.0.95**: Installer path bug - Fixed partial issue with installer copying from wrong directory.
3. **v1.0.94**: Logging suppression in Release builds - Fixed logging not working in production builds.

### Security Fixes (v1.0.77-79)
1. Fixed freemium bypass vulnerabilities
2. Hardened Pro feature gating
3. Added server-side license validation caching
4. Enforced 3-device activation limit

### Reliability Fixes
1. Improved error handling in whisper.exe process management
2. Fixed resource disposal in AudioRecorder
3. Added retry logic for transient failures
4. Better handling of short/long recordings

## üîÑ Breaking Changes

### Hotkey Change
- **Old default**: `Shift+Z`
- **New default**: `Ctrl+Alt+R`
- **Impact**: Users upgrading from v1.0.x will need to re-learn hotkey (or customize in Settings)
- **Reason**: `Shift+Z` conflicts with many applications; `Ctrl+Alt+R` is more universal

### Model File Naming
- Model filenames are now explicit about quantization: `ggml-tiny.bin` (Q8_0 quantized)
- F16 backups available as `*-f16.backup` for rollback if needed

---
