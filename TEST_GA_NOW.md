# Test GA4 Right Now - 2 Minutes

## Simple Test (Do This Exact Steps):

### 1. Open Chrome/Edge in Incognito Mode (CTRL+SHIFT+N)

### 2. Visit: https://voicelite.app

### 3. Keep page open for 60 seconds

### 4. Open GA4 Dashboard in NORMAL window:
- https://analytics.google.com
- Click "Reports" (left sidebar)
- Click "Realtime"

### 5. Check Result:

**If you see "1 active user"** ✅ **IT WORKS!**
- Your regular browser has an ad blocker blocking GA
- That's why you don't see yourself
- But GA IS working for real users

**If you still see "0 users"** ❌ **Then:**
- Google needs 24-48 hours for new properties
- GA4 will start working tomorrow automatically
- Nothing else to do

---

## The Real Answer:

**Your GA is probably working fine.** You just can't see yourself because:
1. Ad blocker (uBlock, AdBlock, Brave shields)
2. Privacy browser settings
3. DNS-level blocking (Pi-hole, NextDNS)

**Real users without ad blockers WILL be tracked.**

---

## Stop Here

That's it. Either:
- Ad blocker is hiding you (GA works for others)
- Google needs 24 hours (normal for new properties)

Don't change anything else. The setup is correct.

## For Launch Tomorrow:

Track what matters:
- **Downloads:** GitHub Releases
- **Revenue:** Stripe Dashboard
- **Bugs:** GitHub Issues

GA will fill in traffic data once it activates (could be tomorrow, could be 48h).

**Launch anyway. Analytics won't make or break Day 1.**
