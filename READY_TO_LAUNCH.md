## 💡 Key Insights from Planning

### Why Open Core Works for VoiceLite

**1. Trust through transparency**
- Privacy-focused product NEEDS code auditing
- Users can verify "100% offline" claim
- Microphone access requires trust

**2. Viral growth potential**
- GitHub stars = free marketing
- Developers share open source more
- SEO boost (GitHub ranks well)
- Media coverage ("open source alternative to Dragon")

**3. Revenue protection**
- Pro models require server-side license validation
- Can't be forked out (license server is private)
- Free tier drives adoption, Pro tier funds development
- 3-5% conversion rate is industry standard

### Why You're Protected from Copying

**What competitors CAN'T steal:**
- ❌ Your license server infrastructure
- ❌ Your customer email list
- ❌ Your brand/SEO/momentum
- ❌ Your Pro feature roadmap
- ❌ Your first-mover advantage

**What competitors CAN see (but doesn't matter):**
- ✅ Basic Whisper integration (already public knowledge)
- ✅ Audio recording code (privacy-critical, needs to be auditable)
- ✅ UI design (they could copy anyway)

**Real examples:**
- GitLab: 100K+ GitHub stars, forked 1000s of times, still $500M revenue
- Sentry: 36K stars, many forks, $100M revenue
- Plausible: 18K stars, 90% of users choose paid SaaS over self-hosting
