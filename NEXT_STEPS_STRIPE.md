## What You Need to Do Now

### STEP 1: Create Stripe Webhook (Required) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This is critical** - without this, customers won't receive their license keys after payment!

1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Make sure you're in **Live mode** (toggle top right)
3. Click **"+ Add endpoint"**
4. Enter:
   - URL: `https://voicelite.app/api/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `charge.refunded`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. Copy the **Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
7. **Paste it here** and I'll update your `.env.local`

üìñ **Detailed instructions**: See [STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md](STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md)

### STEP 2: Get Database URL (Required) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Your app needs a database to store licenses.

**Option A: Use Supabase (Recommended)**

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Go to Project Settings > Database
5. Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)
6. Paste it here

**Option B: Use another PostgreSQL provider**

Any PostgreSQL database works (Neon, Railway, etc.)

### STEP 3: Get Resend API Key (Required) ‚ö†Ô∏è

This sends license keys to customers via email.

1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Go to API Keys
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
6. Paste it here

**Free tier**: 100 emails/day (plenty for launch)

---

### STEP 4: Get Upstash Redis (Optional but Recommended) üîµ

This adds rate limiting to prevent abuse.

1. Go to [https://console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com)
2. Create free account
3. Create a new Redis database
4. Copy the REST URL and Token
5. Paste them here

**Free tier**: 10,000 commands/day

**Note**: App works without this, but you'll lose rate limiting protection.
