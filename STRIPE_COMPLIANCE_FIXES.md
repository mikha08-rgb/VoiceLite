# Stripe Compliance Fixes - Action Required

Based on legal team feedback, here are the critical changes needed before Stripe submission:

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (by me)

### 1. USD Currency
- ‚úÖ Added "USD" to pricing ($20 USD)
- ‚úÖ Visible on homepage pricing section

### 2. Stripe Security Mention
- ‚úÖ Added "Secure checkout via Stripe"
- ‚úÖ Located in pricing card

### 3. Business Entity Visibility
- ‚úÖ Added "Basement Hustle LLC" to footer
- ‚úÖ Created `/business-info` page

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - NEEDS YOUR ACTION

### 1. **Email Address** (URGENT)
**Current:** `support@voicelite.app`, `contact@voicelite.app` (NOT REAL)
**Correct:** `basementhustleLLC@gmail.com`

**Files to update:**
1. `voicelite-web/app/page.tsx` (line ~522)
2. `voicelite-web/app/business-info/page.tsx` (lines ~48, ~53)
3. `voicelite-web/app/legal/refunds/page.tsx` (mentions support email)
4. `voicelite-web/app/terms/page.tsx` (line ~100)
5. `voicelite-web/app/privacy/page.tsx` (Contact section)
6. `voicelite-web/app/basement-hustle-llc/page.tsx` (if keeping this)

**Find & Replace:**
```
Find: support@voicelite.app
Replace: basementhustleLLC@gmail.com

Find: contact@voicelite.app
Replace: basementhustleLLC@gmail.com
```

---

### 2. **Phone Number** (REQUIRED by Stripe)
**Current:** None
**Need:** Real phone number or clear statement

**Add to:**
- Homepage footer (after email)
- `/business-info` page

**Format:**
```
Phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
```

Or if no business phone:
```
Email support preferred. Phone available upon request: [number]
```

---

### 3. **Business Mailing Address** (REQUIRED)
**Current:** "TODO: Your Street Address"
**Need:** Real, verifiable address

**Must match:**
- ‚úÖ Business registration documents
- ‚úÖ EIN application
- ‚úÖ What you tell Stripe

**Options:**
- Physical office
- Home office (if LLC registered there)
- Registered agent address
- Virtual office (with mail forwarding)

**Update in 2 places:**
1. `voicelite-web/app/page.tsx` (footer, lines 516-518)
2. `voicelite-web/app/business-info/page.tsx` (line ~49)

---

### 4. **Link Business Info Page** (Stripe Crawler Requirement)
**Issue:** Page exists but not linked - Stripe's crawler may not find it

**Fix:** Add to footer Legal section

**In `voicelite-web/app/page.tsx`** (around line 610):
```tsx
<li>
  <a href="/business-info" className="transition-colors hover:text-blue-400">
    Business Information
  </a>
</li>
```

---

### 5. **Governing Law Placeholder** (Legal Requirement)
**Current:** "[Your State/Country]" in Terms
**Need:** Specific jurisdiction

**File:** `voicelite-web/app/terms/page.tsx`

**Find:**
```
Governing Law (placeholders: [Your State/Country])
```

**Replace with (example):**
```
Governing Law: Delaware, United States
```

(Use whatever state your LLC is registered in)
