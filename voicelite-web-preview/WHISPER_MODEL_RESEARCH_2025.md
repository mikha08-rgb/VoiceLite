# VoiceLite Whisper Model Research & Recommendations

**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Research Scope**: State-of-the-art Whisper models, fine-tuned variants, offline compatibility
**Current Status**: Using `large-v3` as Pro tier top model

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: Your current `large-v3` model is **NOT** state-of-the-art anymore. There are significantly better options available.

**Recommended Upgrade Path**:
1. **Replace** `large-v3` ‚Üí `large-v3-turbo` for Pro tier (same accuracy as v2, 6x faster)
2. **Add** `distil-large-v3` as new "Ultra Fast" tier option (6x faster than v3, within 1% WER)
3. **Keep** other models (tiny, base, small, medium) unchanged

**Why This Matters**:
- Large-v3-turbo is **6.3x faster** than large-v3 with only minor accuracy loss
- Distil-large-v3 is **6x faster** than large-v3 and **49% smaller** (within 1% WER)
- Both are **100% free** (MIT license) with **no subscription costs**
- Both are **whisper.cpp compatible** for offline use

### Key Performance Metrics (2025 Benchmarks)

**large-v3**:
- WER: 7.88% (AssemblyAI test), 10.3% (Groq benchmark)
- Speed: 1x baseline
- Real-world phone calls: 42.9% WER (WORSE than v2!)
- Clean audio: 19.96% WER

**large-v3-turbo**:
- WER: ~Same as large-v2 (within 1%)
- Speed: **216x real-time** (6.3x faster than v3)
- Architecture: Reduced from 32 to 4 decoder layers
- Parameters: 809M (vs 1.54B in v3)

**distil-large-v3**:
- WER: Within 0.8% of large-v3

## üö® Critical Discovery: Large-v3 Issues

### Performance Degradation on Real-World Audio

Research from Deepgram revealed concerning results:

**Whisper-v3 vs Whisper-v2 (Real-World Data)**:
- **Phone Calls**: v3 WER = 42.9% vs v2 WER = 12.7% (v3 is **3.4x WORSE**)
- **Multi-Person Conversations**: v3 median WER = 53.4% vs v2 WER = 12.7%
- **Videos**: Similar degradation

**Why This Happens**:
- Large-v3 was trained on cleaner datasets (Common Voice, FLEURS)
- Performs well on academic benchmarks but **struggles with real-world audio**
- Especially bad with noisy environments, phone calls, multiple speakers

**Recommendation**: Large-v3 is **NOT** suitable for desktop voice transcription where users may have:
- Background noise
- Low-quality microphones
- Multiple speakers
- Non-studio environments
