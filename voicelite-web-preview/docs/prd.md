# VoiceLite v1.0 - Production Readiness PRD

**Status**: Active
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (Jan 10 - Jan 24, 2025)
**Goal**: Transform vibe-coded project into production-ready v1.0 release

---

## Executive Summary

VoiceLite is **90% feature-complete** but needs production polish. This PRD focuses on the final 10% - cleaning up "vibe code", improving test coverage, and ensuring professional release readiness.

**Core Philosophy**: Don't add features. Fix, test, document, and ship.

**Known Constraints**:
- ‚è∞ **2-week deadline** (aggressive but achievable)
- üìä **Unknown test coverage %** (217 tests exist, need to measure actual coverage)
- üé® **Vibe-coded codebase** (all areas need cleanup)
- ‚ùå **No known critical bugs** (good starting point!)

---

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What Works
- Core transcription flow (recording ‚Üí Whisper ‚Üí text injection)
- 13 active services, all functional
- **Zero build warnings/errors** ‚úÖ
- **217 tests** exist (some failing/timing out, need to fix)
- Installer working
- v1.0.66 released internally
- No known critical bugs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Work (From Developer Assessment)
- **Test Coverage**: Unknown % - need to measure actual coverage
- **Test Reliability**: Some tests timing out (PersistentWhisperService disposal takes 5s)
- **Code Quality**: Vibe-coded ‚Üí inconsistent patterns throughout
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases likely not covered
- **Documentation**: User-facing docs likely minimal
- **Code Cleanup**: "BUG-XXX FIX" comments throughout codebase
- **Performance**: No formal benchmarking done

---

## Product Goals

### Primary Goal
**Ship production-ready v1.0 in 2 weeks** (Jan 24, 2025)

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ 0 critical bugs
- ‚úÖ ‚â•80% test coverage (currently ~75% target)
- ‚úÖ All services have comprehensive tests
- ‚úÖ Professional error messages (no stack traces to users)
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ User documentation exists
- ‚úÖ Installer tested on fresh Windows installs

2. Create architecture.md from CLAUDE.md
3. Break down into manageable stories
4. Start with Epic 1 (Code Quality)
5. Work through epics systematically

**Questions Resolved**:
1. ‚úÖ Timeline: **2 weeks** (Jan 10-24, 2025)
2. ‚úÖ Known bugs: **None critical** (PersistentWhisperService slow disposal is perf issue, not bug)
3. ‚úÖ Messy areas: **Vibe-coded throughout** (all areas need cleanup)
4. ‚úÖ Test coverage: **Unknown %** (217 tests exist, will measure in Day 1)
5. ‚ùì Installer testing: **Unknown** (will test in Week 2)
