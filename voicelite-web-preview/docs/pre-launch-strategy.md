# Pre-Launch Website Strategy (No Users Yet)

## 🎯 Current Situation
- **Status**: About to launch to production
- **Users**: 0 (pre-launch)
- **Challenge**: Can't use real stats/testimonials yet

---

## ✅ What to Keep from v2 Mockup

1. ✅ **Navigation bar** - Essential
2. ✅ **Blue CTAs** - Professional vibe
3. ✅ **Feature cards** - Shows value prop
4. ✅ **How It Works** - Explains product
5. ✅ **Model comparison** - Educational, builds trust
6. ✅ **Pricing card** - Clear offer
7. ✅ **FAQ** - Answers objections
8. ✅ **Footer** - Standard structure

---

## ❌ What to Remove/Change for Pre-Launch

### 1. **Social Proof Section** → Change Strategy
**Current**: "1,000+ Downloads • 4.8★ Rating"
**Problem**: You have 0 users, feels dishonest

**Options**:

**Option A**: Remove entirely (simplest)
- Just remove the stats section
- Launch without it
- Add later when you hit real milestones

**Option B**: Use GitHub stars instead
```html
⭐ 47 GitHub Stars • 🔓 100% Open Source • 🆓 MIT License
```
- Use actual GitHub metrics
- Shows transparency
- Feels authentic

**Option C**: Use "Pre-Launch" messaging
```html
🚀 Launching Soon • 🔓 Open Source • 💻 Made for Developers
```
- Honest about being new
- Appeals to early adopters
- No fake numbers

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Use GitHub stars - real numbers)

---

### 2. **Testimonial Section** → Remove or Change
**Current**: "Jake Sullivan, Senior Developer at Microsoft"
**Problem**: Fake testimonial = trust killer

**Options**:

**Option A**: Remove entirely ✅ (Recommended)
- Launch without testimonials
- Add real ones after first 10-20 customers
- Collect via email: "Mind sharing your experience?"

**Option B**: Use beta tester quote (if you have one)
- Only if you have real beta testers
- Must be authentic
- Include real name + photo

**Option C**: Replace with "Why I Built This" founder story
```html
"I got tired of slow, cloud-based dictation tools.
I wanted something private, fast, and offline.
So I built VoiceLite."

— Misha, Founder & Developer
```
- Authentic personal story
- Shows motivation
- Builds connection with indie hacker community

**Recommendation**: **Option C** (Founder story) or **Option A** (Remove)

---

### 3. **Pricing Button** → Add Launch Discount
**Current**: "Buy Now - $20"
**Problem**: No urgency, no launch hook

**Change to**:
```html
Pre-Launch Price: $15 $20
[Buy Now - Save $5]

Launch price: $15 (save $5) • Regular price: $20
Offer ends: [7 days from now]
```

**Why**:
- Creates urgency for early adopters
- You get initial customers to build testimonials
- Can raise to $20 after launch
- $15 feels like a steal, removes purchase hesitation

**Alternative**: Keep $20 but add launch bonus
```html
Buy Now - $20
🎁 Launch Bonus: Get early access to VoiceLite 2.0 features
```

**Recommendation**: $15 pre-launch discount (builds initial user base)

---

### 4. **"Trusted by" Heading** → Change to "Built for"
**Current**: "Trusted by developers and writers"
**Problem**: Implies existing users

**Change to**:
```html
Built for Developers & Writers
```
- Honest (you built it FOR them, not claiming they use it)
- Same positioning, no false claims
- Can change to "Trusted by" after 100+ users

---

### 5. **Download Numbers** → Use GitHub Metrics
**Current**: "1,000+ Downloads"
**Problem**: You have 0

**Options**:

**Option A**: Show GitHub stars (real data)
```html
⭐ 47 Stars on GitHub
```

**Option B**: Show commit count (shows effort)
```html
📦 500+ Commits • 👨‍💻 Active Development
```

**Option C**: Remove stats entirely
- Just have the features/benefits

**Recommendation**: **Option A** (GitHub stars - transparent and real)

---

## 🎨 Adjusted v3 Mockup Changes

```html
Before: "Join 1,000+ users who've gone voice-first"
After:  "Be one of the first to go voice-first"

```

### **Social Proof Section** → GitHub Metrics

   with 500+ commits and extensive testing. The core
   features are production-ready.
```

## 🚀 Pre-Launch Go-to-Market Strategy

### **Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)**
1. Ship with founder story (no fake testimonials)

3. Show real GitHub metrics only
4. Post to:
   - r/SideProject
   - r/IndieDev
   - Hacker News "Show HN: VoiceLite"
   - Product Hunt

**Goal**: 10-50 early customers

---

### **Phase 2: Collect Testimonials (Week 2-4)**
1. Email customers after 7 days: "How's VoiceLite working?"
2. Ask for short quote + photo
3. Offer $5 refund for testimonial (optional incentive)
4. Build case studies (2-3 detailed)

**Goal**: 3-5 strong testimonials with photos

---

### **Phase 3: Add Social Proof (Month 2)**
1. Replace founder story with real testimonials
2. Update stats to real numbers: "X downloads in first month"
3. Raise price to $20 (early adopters saved $5)
4. Add "As Seen On" badges if featured anywhere

**Goal**: Convert site from "pre-launch" to "proven"

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Let me create a "v3 Pre-Launch" mockup with:**
- ✅ No fake stats (use GitHub stars instead)
- ✅ Founder story instead of testimonial
- ✅ $15 launch pricing (creates urgency)
- ✅ "Be one of the first" messaging
- ✅ Honest, transparent positioning

**This will convert better than fake stats** because:
- Early adopters LOVE being first
- Transparency builds trust (indie hacker cred)
- $15 discount removes purchase hesitation
- You collect real testimonials from first users

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Option A**: I create v3 with pre-launch adjustments (10 min)
- Honest positioning
- $15 launch pricing
- Real GitHub metrics
- Founder story

**Option B**: Build v2 as-is, I'll adjust live content later
- Ship faster, iterate after

**What do you prefer?** I highly recommend Option A - launching with fake stats will hurt you more than help.
