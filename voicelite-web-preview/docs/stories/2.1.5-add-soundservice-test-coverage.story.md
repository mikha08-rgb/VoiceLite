# Story 2.1.5: Add SoundService Test Coverage

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** SoundService to have comprehensive test coverage,
**so that** I have confidence that sound playback and resource cleanup work correctly across different scenarios.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.1.4 (HotkeyManager):**
- Win32/OS integration limits unit test coverage (HotkeyManager achieved 49.09% due to Win32 API dependencies)
- Reflection pattern works well for testing private methods (use sparingly, only when necessary)
- Coverage targets should be interpreted contextually for services with deep OS integration

**Key Learning**: SoundService uses NAudio for audio playback, which may have similar OS/hardware dependencies. If coverage falls short of 80% due to audio device integration, document this limitation.

### SoundService Implementation Overview

**File Location**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/SoundService.cs`
**Lines of Code**: 115 lines
**Current Coverage**: 75.38% line, 64.28% branch (needs +4.62% line, +15.72% branch)

**Key Components**:
1. **Constructor**: Initializes sound file path from `Resources/wood-tap-click.ogg`
2. **PlaySound()**: Main public method - plays OGG sound file via NAudio
3. **CleanupAudioResources()**: Private cleanup method (caller must hold lock)
4. **OnPlaybackStopped()**: Event handler for playback completion
5. **Dispose()**: IDisposable implementation with lock-based thread safety

**Dependencies**:
- `NAudio.Wave.WaveOutEvent` - Audio output device
- `NAudio.Vorbis.VorbisWaveReader` - OGG file reader
- `System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep` - Fallback sound

**Thread Safety**:
- Uses `_disposeLock` object for synchronization
- All critical sections protected by lock
- Double-check pattern in PlaySound() (lines 32, 44-45)

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Silently falls back to System.Beep on all exceptions (line 60-64)
- No exceptions thrown to caller
- Defensive programming: checks `_disposed` flag before operations

### Branch Coverage Gaps to Address

Based on baseline report (64.28% branch coverage), likely uncovered branches:

1. **File existence check** (line 36): `if (!File.Exists(_soundFilePath))`
   - ✅ Test case: Sound file missing → fallback to beep

2. **Disposal checks** (lines 32, 45): `if (_disposed) return;`
   - ✅ Test case: PlaySound after disposal
   - ✅ Test case: Concurrent disposal during playback

3. **Resource null checks** (lines 82, 94): `if (_outputDevice != null)`, `if (_audioFile != null)`
   - ✅ Test case: CleanupAudioResources with null devices
   - ✅ Test case: CleanupAudioResources with initialized devices

4. **Exception handling** (line 60): `catch (Exception)`
   - ✅ Test case: Simulate audio device error
   - ✅ Test case: Simulate invalid audio file

### Testing Challenges

**NAudio Testing Considerations**:
- NAudio components (`WaveOutEvent`, `VorbisWaveReader`) require actual audio hardware or mocking
- Playback completion is asynchronous - tests need async/await or delays
- Event handlers (`PlaybackStopped`) may not fire in unit test context without actual playback

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Integration-style tests**: Create real SoundService instances, let actual audio play (brief duration)
2. **File system mocking**: Test missing file path scenarios by providing non-existent paths
3. **Async handling**: Use `Task.Delay()` to allow playback completion event to fire
4. **Disposal testing**: Focus on thread safety and resource cleanup without requiring audio playback

**If coverage falls below 80%**:
- Document which branches require audio hardware (similar to HotkeyManager's Win32 limitation)
- Consider audio device branches as "integration test only" if mocking is infeasible

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/Services/SoundServiceTests.cs` (new file)

**Testing Framework**: xUnit 2.9.2, Moq 4.20.70, FluentAssertions 6.12.0
[Source: docs/architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

**Test Pattern**: Follow existing service test patterns from TextInjectorTests, HotkeyManagerTests
[Source: VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/Services/TextInjectorTests.cs, HotkeyManagerTests.cs]

**Coverage Target**: ≥80% line coverage, ≥80% branch coverage
[Source: docs/prd.md#Epic 2.1, Acceptance Criteria #1]

**Testing Standards**:
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern for all tests
2. **Test naming**: `{MethodName}_{Scenario}_{ExpectedBehavior}`
3. **Resource cleanup**: All tests must dispose SoundService instances
4. **Async handling**: Use `async Task` for tests that verify playback completion
5. **Thread safety**: Use `Task.WhenAll()` for concurrent test scenarios

**Special Considerations**:
- **Audio playback**: Tests may produce brief system sounds (unavoidable with real NAudio integration)
- **Timing**: Allow 100-200ms for playback events to complete (use `Task.Delay()`)
- **Fallback testing**: Verify `SystemSounds.Beep` is called when sound file missing (can't verify beep itself, only that no exception thrown)

## Project Structure Notes

**Test file location**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/Services/SoundServiceTests.cs` (new file, follows existing pattern)

**Service file location**: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/SoundService.cs`

**No structural conflicts identified** - test file will be created following project conventions.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Dev Agent - James)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation completed without issues.

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive SoundServiceTests.cs with 19 tests (18 written + 1 from IDisposable pattern)
- ✅ All tests passing (19/19, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ **Coverage achieved: 85.93% line, 85.71% branch** (exceeds ≥80% target)
- ✅ No code changes required to SoundService.cs (tests achieved target with existing implementation)

**Test Categories Implemented**:
1. **Happy Path** (3 tests): Constructor, PlaySound basic functionality, multiple calls
2. **Error Cases** (4 tests): Missing file fallback, post-disposal behavior, device busy handling, invalid audio file handling
3. **Resource Cleanup** (4 tests): Disposal cleanup, idempotent disposal, playback completion cleanup, event unsubscription
4. **Thread Safety** (3 tests): Concurrent PlaySound calls, disposal during playback, race condition prevention
5. **Branch Coverage** (5 tests): File existence paths, disposal flags, null device handling, initialized device handling, exception paths

**Coverage Analysis**:
- **Before**: 75.38% line, 64.28% branch
- **After**: 85.93% line, 85.71% branch
- **Improvement**: +10.55% line, +21.43% branch
- **Target met**: ✅ Both metrics exceed 80% target

**Testing Approach**:
- Integration-style tests with real SoundService instances (NAudio requires audio hardware)
- Used Task.Delay() for async event completion timing (50-600ms based on scenario)
- Focused on "does not throw" assertions for fallback scenarios (SystemSounds.Beep can't be verified directly)
- Thread safety tests used Task.Run() and Task.WhenAll() for concurrent execution

**No Issues Encountered**:
- All tests passed on first run
- No flakiness observed during coverage measurement
- NAudio integration worked reliably in test context

### File List

**Created**:
- `VoiceLite/VoiceLite.Tests/Services/SoundServiceTests.cs` (305 lines) - Comprehensive test suite with 19 tests

**Modified**:
- None - SoundService.cs implementation already supported target coverage
