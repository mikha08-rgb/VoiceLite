## Next Steps

1. **Fill in the lists above** with what YOU know needs to be done
2. **Prioritize** - what's critical vs nice-to-have?
3. **Estimate** - roughly how big is each item? (Small/Medium/Large)
4. Create a PRD and break it into epics/stories

## Questions to Consider

- **Timeline**: When do you want to ship v1.0?
- **Scope**: What's MVP for "production ready" vs post-launch?
- **Resources**: Solo developer or team? How many hours/week?
- **Risk**: What's the biggest technical risk remaining?

**Once you fill this in, I'll create the full PRD and architecture docs!**
