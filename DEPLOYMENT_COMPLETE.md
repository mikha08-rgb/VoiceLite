**Build Time**: 4 minutes 37 seconds
**GitHub Actions**: Success (all steps passed)

## üéØ Deployment Summary

### Critical Fix
**VC++ Runtime Installation Timing Issue** (Root cause of v1.0.60 failures)

**Problem**:
- `InstallVCRuntimeIfNeeded()` was called at `ssInstall` step (before files copied)
- When code tried to access `{tmp}\vc_redist.x64.exe`, file didn't exist yet
- Resulted in "Visual C++ Runtime installer is missing from setup package" error
- Affected both Full and Lite installers

**Solution**:
- Moved VC++ installation from `ssInstall` (Pascal code) to `[Run]` section (declarative)
- `[Run]` section executes AFTER files are copied, ensuring `{tmp}\vc_redist.x64.exe` exists
- Industry standard approach for prerequisite installations
- Verification logic kept in `ssPostInstall` to check if installation succeeded

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Installer now works in Windows Sandbox and airgapped environments
- ‚úÖ VC++ Runtime installs reliably without user intervention
- ‚úÖ Both Full and Lite installers fixed
- ‚úÖ No more false "missing installer" errors
