- ✅ Removed UIPreset.StatusHero enum (not implemented)
- ✅ Hid "Manage Custom Filler Words" button (not implemented)
- ✅ Standardized error message titles to "Settings Error"
- ✅ Made hotkey hints dynamic (GetHotkeyDisplayString)
- ✅ Increased default MaxHistoryItems from 10 to 50

### 2. Critical Reliability Fixes (8 fixes)

#### CRIT-005: Watchdog Race Condition (RecordingCoordinator.cs)
**Issue**: Transcription completion and watchdog timeout could fire simultaneously, causing duplicate events and UI confusion.

**Fix**: Used `Interlocked.CompareExchange` for atomic flag checking.
```csharp
// Before: volatile bool transcriptionCompleted
// After: int transcriptionCompletedFlag (atomic operations)
bool wasCompleted = Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref transcriptionCompletedFlag, 1, 0) == 1;
if (!wasCompleted) {
    // Only first completion fires event
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminates duplicate "Transcribed successfully" notifications and prevents stuck UI state.

---

#### CRIT-004: Semaphore Double-Release (PersistentWhisperService.cs)
**Issue**: If exception occurred before semaphore acquisition, finally block would attempt double-release, crashing the app.

**Fix**: Moved `WaitAsync` inside try block.
```csharp
// Before:
await transcriptionSemaphore.WaitAsync();
semaphoreAcquired = true;
try { ... }

// After:
try {
    await transcriptionSemaphore.WaitAsync();
    semaphoreAcquired = true;
    ...
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents rare crash on transcription timeout or error.

---

#### CRIT-003: Cleanup Timer Disposal Order (AudioRecorder.cs)
**Issue**: Setting `isDisposed = true` before stopping timer could allow timer callback to fire during disposal, causing null reference exceptions.

**Fix**: Reversed disposal order.
```csharp
// Before:
isDisposed = true;
cleanupTimer?.Stop();

// After:
cleanupTimer?.Stop();
cleanupTimer = null;
isDisposed = true; // Set AFTER stopping timer
```

**Impact**: Prevents rare crash on AudioRecorder disposal.

---

#### CRIT-002: Event Handler Exceptions (MainWindow.xaml.cs)
**Issue**: Unhandled exceptions in OnHotkeyPressed/OnHotkeyReleased could crash the app or leave it in a broken state.

**Fix**: Added try-catch wrappers with state recovery.
```csharp
private void OnHotkeyPressed(object? sender, EventArgs e) {
    try {
        // existing logic
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
        ErrorLogger.LogError("CRITICAL: OnHotkeyPressed exception", ex);
        // Attempt state recovery
        if (isRecording) StopRecording(cancel: true);
        // Notify user
        MessageBox.Show($"Hotkey system error: {ex.Message}...");
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Graceful error recovery instead of silent failure or crash.

---

#### CRIT-001: XAML Null Safety (MainWindow.xaml.cs)
**Issue**: Accessing HotkeyText, MicrophoneText, ModelText before XAML initialization could cause null reference exceptions.

**Fix**: Added defensive null checks.
```csharp
if (HotkeyText != null) {
    HotkeyText.Text = GetHotkeyDisplayString();
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents rare startup crash if UpdateConfigDisplay called before InitializeComponent.

---

#### HIGH-001: Timer Memory Leak (MainWindow.xaml.cs)
**Issue**: Lambda reference not stored, preventing proper event unsubscription, causing timer memory leak.

**Fix**: Stored lambda in variable for proper cleanup.
```csharp
EventHandler? tickHandler = null;
tickHandler = (s, args) => {
    try { /* logic */ }
    finally {
        revertTimer.Stop();
        if (tickHandler != null) {
            revertTimer.Tick -= tickHandler; // Uses same reference
        }
    }
};
revertTimer.Tick += tickHandler;
```

**Impact**: Prevents slow memory leak over extended use.

---

#### HIGH-002: Nested Lock Deadlock (AudioRecorder.cs)
**Issue**: Lock inside lock could cause deadlock if outer lock held by another thread.

**Fix**: Removed redundant nested lock.
```csharp
// Before:
lock (lockObject) { // Outer lock (line 334)
    // ...
    lock (lockObject) { // NESTED LOCK - dangerous!
        localWaveFile = waveFile;
    }
}

// After:
lock (lockObject) { // Already inside lock
    localWaveFile = waveFile; // No nested lock needed
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents rare recording freeze/hang.

---

#### HIGH-003: Process Property Access (PersistentWhisperService.cs)
**Issue**: Accessing `Process.PriorityClass` after process exits throws exception.

**Fix**: Added HasExited check.
```csharp
if (!process.HasExited) {
    process.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.AboveNormal;
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents rare warmup crash on slow systems.

---

### 3. Dispatcher Exception Handling (6 locations)

Added `TaskCanceledException` handling to all async void event handlers to prevent event log noise during app shutdown:

1. ✅ **OnAutoTimeout** (line 1494)
2. ✅ **OnRecordingStatusChanged** (line 1536)
3. ✅ **OnTranscriptionCompleted** (line 1609)
4. ✅ **OnRecordingError** (line 1802)
5. ✅ **OnMemoryAlert** (line 1835)
6. ✅ **OnStuckStateRecovery** (line 1391)

**Pattern Applied**:
```csharp
try {
    await Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(() => { /* UI work */ });
}
catch (TaskCanceledException) {
    ErrorLogger.LogMessage("{Method}: Dispatcher shutting down (app closing)");
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    ErrorLogger.LogError("{Method}", ex);
}
```

**Impact**: Eliminates event log spam during clean shutdown, improves debugging experience.
