# Next Steps Summary - Git History Scrubbing

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Ready to execute, waiting for Java installation

---

## Current Situation

✅ **What's Done:**
- Scripts fixed (removed Unicode characters causing parse errors)
- All safety checks implemented
- Multiple installation paths available
- Commits pushed to GitHub (ready for history rewrite)

❌ **What's Blocking:**
- Java is **NOT installed** on your system
- BFG Repo-Cleaner requires Java to run

---

## Fastest Path Forward (15 minutes total)

### Step 1: Install Java (5 minutes)

**Download Java 11:**
- Visit: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11
- Select: Windows x64 JDK
- Click: `.msi` installer (easier)
- Run installer with defaults

**Verify installation:**
```powershell
java -version
```

Should show something like: `openjdk version "11.0.x"`

---

### Step 2: Download BFG (2 minutes)

Run the manual setup script in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mishk\Codingprojects\SpeakLite\HereWeGoAgain v3.3 Fuck"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File manual-bfg-setup.ps1
```

This will:
- Download BFG to your Downloads folder
- Verify it works with Java
- Tell you the path to use

---

### Step 3: Run Git History Scrubbing (10 minutes)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scrub-git-history.ps1 -BfgPath "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\bfg.jar"
```

**What happens:**
1. Safety checks (verify repo, commits pushed, secrets exist)
2. Confirmation prompt (type "DELETE HISTORY")
3. Creates git mirror clone
4. Runs BFG to delete files from ALL commits
5. Verifies secrets removed
6. Force pushes to GitHub

**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

## Alternative: Use Chocolatey (Slower but Automated)

If you prefer a package manager:

### Step 1: Install Chocolatey (5 minutes)

Run in **Administrator PowerShell**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1"))
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script (5 minutes)

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\mishk\Codingprojects\SpeakLite\HereWeGoAgain v3.3 Fuck"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup-bfg.ps1
```

### Step 3: Run Scrubbing Script (10 minutes)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scrub-git-history.ps1
```

---

## After Scrubbing Completes

### 1. Update Your Local Repository

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mishk\Codingprojects\SpeakLite\HereWeGoAgain v3.3 Fuck"
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### 2. Verify on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/mikha08-rgb/VoiceLite/search?q=vS89Zv4vrDNoM9zXm5aAsba&type=commits

Should show: **NO RESULTS**

### 3. Verify Locally

```bash
git log --all --full-history -p -S "vS89Zv4vrDNoM9zXm5aAsba"
```

Should show: **NOTHING**

## Phase 1 Progress Tracker

**SEC-001: Exposed Credentials in Git History**

- [x] Step 1.1: Push commits to origin (✅ COMPLETED)
- [ ] **Step 1.2: Scrub git history (⏸️ WAITING FOR JAVA)**
- [ ] Step 1.3: Verify secrets removed
- [ ] Step 1.4: Generate new Ed25519 keypairs
- [ ] Step 1.5: Rotate production credentials
- [ ] Step 1.6: Update desktop app with new public keys
- [ ] Step 1.7: Deploy and test

**Estimated Time Remaining**: 4-6 hours after scrubbing completes

## Files You Need

All ready in your project directory:

1. **START_HERE.md** - Quick decision tree
2. **manual-bfg-setup.ps1** - Fast setup (Java only)
3. **setup-bfg.ps1** - Full setup (Chocolatey + Java + BFG)
4. **scrub-git-history.ps1** - Main scrubbing script
5. **QUICK_START_SCRUB.md** - Detailed guide
6. **GIT_HISTORY_SCRUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Manual step-by-step

---

## What's Being Deleted

These files will be **PERMANENTLY removed** from ALL commits:

1. `add-secrets-to-vercel.sh`
   - Contains: LICENSE_SIGNING_PRIVATE, CRL_SIGNING_PRIVATE, MIGRATION_SECRET

2. `SECRET_ROTATION_COMPLETE.md`
   - Contains: Documentation of exposed keys

**Impact**: Attackers will NO LONGER be able to forge Pro licenses

---

## Safety Features Built-In

✅ Multiple safety checks before execution
✅ Dry-run mode available (`-DryRun`)
✅ Verification step before force push
✅ Requires typing "DELETE HISTORY" to confirm
✅ Git mirror clone (easy rollback)
✅ No changes to working directory until final step

---

## Recommended Action NOW

**Copy this command and run it in your browser:**

```
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11
```

1. Download the Windows x64 `.msi` installer
2. Run the installer
3. Come back and run `manual-bfg-setup.ps1`
4. Then run `scrub-git-history.ps1`

**Total time**: 15 minutes from now to complete git history scrubbing

---

## Need Help During Execution?

All scripts include:
- Colored output (Green = success, Red = error, Yellow = warning)
- Clear error messages
- Instructions for next steps
- Automatic verification

If anything fails, the script will:
- Stop immediately
- Show clear error message
- Provide troubleshooting steps
- NOT force push (safe rollback)

---

## After This Step

Once git history is clean, next steps are:

1. Generate new Ed25519 keypairs (I can help with this)
2. Rotate production credentials (Supabase, Stripe, Resend, Upstash)
3. Update desktop app with new public keys
4. Test and deploy

See `RELEASE_UNBLOCK_PLAN.md` for full roadmap.
