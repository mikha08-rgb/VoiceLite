## Response Templates (Copy-Paste Ready)

### "How is this different from Dragon?"
```
Great question! VoiceLite is:
- 100% offline (Dragon requires internet for some features)
- Free tier with unlimited usage (Dragon is $300+)
- Auditable code (you can verify privacy yourself)
- Built specifically for developers (great with technical terms)
```

### "Why can I see the source code?"
```
Transparency! Since VoiceLite accesses your microphone, I wanted users to verify there's no telemetry or cloud uploads. The entire audio pipeline is MIT licensed - audit it yourself.
```

### "Can you really make money with open core?"
```
That's the experiment! GitLab, Sentry, and Plausible prove it works. My thesis: developers who need premium accuracy will pay $20/3mo, while free tier drives adoption. So far: 1% conversion rate = sustainable.
```

### "Does it work in [specific app]?"
```
Yes! VoiceLite works in any Windows application with a text field. I personally use it in [specific example]. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you!
```

### "What about Linux/Mac?"
```
Windows-only for now (uses WPF + Win32 APIs). Mac/Linux versions are on the roadmap! Star the GitHub repo to follow progress.
```
