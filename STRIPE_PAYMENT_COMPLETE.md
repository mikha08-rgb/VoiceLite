## Issues Fixed During Implementation

### Issue 1: Trailing Newlines in Environment Variables
**Problem**: Stripe API keys had `\n` at the end, breaking authentication
**Solution**: Used `printf` instead of `echo` when adding env vars
**Fixed in**: Vercel production environment

### Issue 2: Wrong Resend API Key
**Problem**: Using sandbox key `re_sbp_...` instead of production key
**Solution**: Updated to production key `re_Vn4JijC8_...`
**Fixed in**: Vercel production environment

### Issue 3: Database Connection with pgBouncer
**Problem**: Prisma `findUnique` failing with "unexpected message from server"
**Solution**: Changed from pooler (port 6543) to direct connection (port 5432) with URL-encoded password
**Fixed in**: DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Issue 4: Email Field in SaveLicense
**Problem**: Desktop app couldn't save license because email was required but not returned by API
**Solution**: Made email parameter optional in `SimpleLicenseStorage.SaveLicense()`
**Fixed in**: [SimpleLicenseStorage.cs](VoiceLite/VoiceLite/Services/SimpleLicenseStorage.cs#L143)

### Issue 5: Webhook Email Sending
**Problem**: `sendLicenseEmail` function signature mismatch
**Solution**: Fixed function calls to pass object with `{email, licenseKey, plan}`
**Fixed in**: [webhook/route.ts](voicelite-web/app/api/webhook/route.ts#L134-L138)

## Known Issue: License Activation UI

### Problem
When a user activates a license in the desktop app:
1. ✅ License validates successfully
2. ✅ License saves to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VoiceLite\license.dat` (DPAPI encrypted)
3. ❌ **App doesn't reload license state until manual restart**

### Impact
Users see "Free version" in UI even after successful activation until they manually close and reopen the app.

### Root Cause
The app loads license status once at startup in `MainWindow` constructor. After saving a license through Settings, the in-memory state isn't refreshed.

### Temporary Workaround
Tell users to **close and reopen VoiceLite** after activating their license.

### Permanent Fix Needed
Add a method to reload license status without restarting:
1. Create `ReloadLicenseStatus()` method in MainWindow
2. Call it after successful activation in LicenseActivationDialog
3. Update UI to reflect Pro status immediately

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Purchase completes on voicelite.app
- [x] License created in database
- [x] Email delivered to customer
- [x] License validates in desktop app
- [x] License activates in desktop app
- [x] License persists after restart (manual restart required)

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Fix license reload** - Add automatic restart or in-memory refresh after activation
2. **Test webhook delivery** - Verify Stripe webhooks are reaching our server
3. **Monitor email delivery** - Check Resend dashboard for delivery rates

### Low Priority
4. Document customer support process for license issues
5. Add admin dashboard for viewing/managing licenses
6. Set up monitoring for failed payments/emails
