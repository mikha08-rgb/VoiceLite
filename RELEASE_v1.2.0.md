## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Text Injection Improvements** (Adaptive & Configurable)

**Adaptive Typing Delays:**
- Modern apps (Notepad, Chrome, VS Code): 1ms per character (50% faster than v1.1.51)
- Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint): 2ms per character (proven reliability)
- Terminals (CMD, PowerShell): 5ms per character (compatibility)
- Default: 2ms for unknown applications

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Faster text injection in modern apps
- ‚úÖ No dropped characters (tested across multiple apps)
- ‚úÖ Application-specific optimization

**User-Configurable Clipboard Restoration Delay:**
- New Settings UI slider (30-100ms range)
- Default: 50ms (optimal for most systems)
- Allows users to balance speed vs reliability based on their system

**Note:** UI Automation scaffolding added but currently disabled (SetValue() replaces field content instead of inserting at cursor - requires TextPattern implementation).

### 2. **Audio Preprocessing Pipeline** (Quality Improvement)

**New Components:**
- **Automatic Gain Control (AGC)**: Normalizes audio levels for consistent transcription
- **High-Pass Filter**: Removes low-frequency noise (< 80Hz)
- **Simple Noise Gate**: Filters background noise below threshold
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatically trims silence

**User Controls (Settings ‚Üí General):**
- VAD enable/disable checkbox
- VAD sensitivity slider (0.3-0.8)
- Visual feedback and real-time preview

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Better transcription accuracy in noisy environments
- ‚úÖ Reduced file sizes (silence trimmed)
- ‚úÖ User customization for different recording scenarios

**Related Commit:** `466c954`

### 3. **Toggle Recording Mode as Default** (UX Improvement)

**Change:**
- Toggle mode is now the default (press once to start, press again to stop)
- Provides Dragon NaturallySpeaking-like user experience
- Push-to-Talk still available as option

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ More natural dictation workflow for longer sessions
- ‚úÖ Hands-free operation (no need to hold key)
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard UX pattern

**Related Commit:** `880512a`

### 4. **Automated Shipping Workflow** (Developer Experience)

**New Slash Commands:**
- `/ship-app` - Automated desktop app release workflow
- `/ship-web` - Automated web deployment workflow
- `/update-download-links` - Sync version numbers across repos

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent release process
- ‚úÖ Version number synchronization
- ‚úÖ Reduced manual errors

**Related Commit:** `061d643`

## üß™ Quality Assurance

### **Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **289/289 unit tests passing** (100% pass rate)
- ‚úÖ **42 tests skipped** (stress/integration tests - expected)
- ‚úÖ **0 build errors, 4 pre-existing warnings** (test code only)
- ‚úÖ **Release build verified** (0 errors)

### **Manual Testing Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Text injection: Short phrases (5-10 words) in Notepad, Word, Chrome
- ‚úÖ Text injection: Long phrases (50+ words) via clipboard paste
- ‚úÖ Toggle recording mode: Rapid start/stop cycles (stable)
- ‚úÖ Audio preprocessing: VAD settings tested in quiet/noisy environments
- ‚úÖ Clipboard delay slider: Settings save and persist correctly
- ‚úÖ Log analysis: No crashes, errors, or exceptions

### **Reliability Verification:**
- ‚úÖ No dropped characters during text injection
- ‚úÖ No data loss (doesn't delete existing text)
- ‚úÖ Stable across 10+ transcriptions
- ‚úÖ Clean application shutdown
