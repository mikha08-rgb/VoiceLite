## Active MCPs (Built-in)

These MCPs are already active in your Claude Code instance:

1. **sequential-thinking** - Multi-step reasoning for complex analysis
2. **context7** - Up-to-date .NET/WPF/Next.js documentation
3. **augments** - Framework documentation cache
4. **magic (21st.dev)** - UI component library

---

## Installation Completed

‚úÖ Installed `@notprolands/ast-grep-mcp@1.1.1` (90 packages)
‚úÖ Installed `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@0.5.5` (97 packages)
‚úÖ Installed `vibe-check-mcp@latest` (1 package)
‚úÖ Connected to hosted `semgrep` MCP at https://mcp.semgrep.ai

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Code** to activate all 6 MCPs
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"

2. **Review Usage Guides**
   - [MCP_USAGE_GUIDE.md](./MCP_USAGE_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive examples for all 6 MCPs
   - [AST_GREP_EXAMPLES.md](./AST_GREP_EXAMPLES.md) - 10+ ast-grep examples

3. **Set up environment variables** (for Supabase)
   - Create `.env` with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - Use development database only (never production)

4. **Start architecture audit** using the improved prompt

---

## Quick Start Examples

After restarting Claude Code, try:

**ast-grep** (Semantic search):
```
"Use ast-grep to find all static singleton usages in the codebase"
"Use ast-grep to map service dependencies in MainWindow.xaml.cs"
```

**Supabase** (Database management):
```
"Use Supabase to show schema for licenses table"
"Use Supabase to query analytics events from last 30 days"
```

**Vibe Check** (Refactoring mentor):
```
"Vibe check: Should I extract SettingsManager now or after WindowManager?"
"Vibe check: Is creating 5 new coordinators over-engineering?"
```

**Semgrep** (Security scanning):
```
"Use Semgrep to scan API routes for vulnerabilities"
"Use Semgrep to find hardcoded secrets in the codebase"
```

See [MCP_USAGE_GUIDE.md](./MCP_USAGE_GUIDE.md) for complete examples and workflows.

## Why These MCPs?

### ‚úÖ github (Keep)
- **Used for**: Creating releases, viewing CI/CD runs, managing issues
- **Value**: You have `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
- **Frequency**: High (every release, PR check)

### ‚úÖ stripe (Keep)
- **Used for**: Payment processing, subscription management
- **Value**: You have `voicelite-web/` with Stripe checkout integration
- **Frequency**: Medium (payment webhook debugging, subscription checks)

### ‚úÖ ast-grep (Added)
- **Used for**: Architecture audit, dependency mapping, refactoring safety
- **Value**: 2,183-line MainWindow needs systematic analysis
- **Frequency**: High during refactoring phase, low during maintenance

### ‚úÖ supabase (Added)
- **Used for**: Database schema management, migrations, analytics queries
- **Value**: PostgreSQL backend with Prisma ORM needs schema work
- **Frequency**: Medium (schema changes, analytics)

### ‚úÖ vibe-check (Added)
- **Used for**: Refactoring sanity checks, preventing over-engineering
- **Value**: Complex architecture refactoring needs meta-mentor validation
- **Frequency**: High during refactoring, low during maintenance
- **Research**: 2x success improvement (27% ‚Üí 54%)

### ‚úÖ semgrep (Added)
- **Used for**: Security scanning, vulnerability detection
- **Value**: Payment backend needs security validation
- **Frequency**: High (pre-commit checks, API audits)
- **Rules**: 5,000+ security rules (free tier)

### ‚ùå filesystem (Removed)
- **Why removed**: Claude Code already has Read/Write/Edit/Glob built-in
- **Conflict risk**: Duplicate tools can cause permission issues
- **No value**: Everything filesystem does is covered by native tools

---

## Architecture Audit Workflow

With 6 MCPs configured, your enhanced workflow is:

1. **Analyze** (ast-grep, semgrep, supabase)
   - Map dependencies with ast-grep
   - Find static singletons with ast-grep
   - Scan for security issues with semgrep
   - Query error metrics with supabase

2. **Plan** (vibe-check, sequential-thinking, context7)
   - Use vibe-check to validate refactoring approach
   - Use sequential-thinking for step-by-step analysis
   - Reference .NET DI patterns from context7
   - Create refactoring roadmap

3. **Execute** (Read, Edit, Write, vibe-check)
   - Extract classes incrementally
   - Vibe check each extraction decision
   - Test after each extraction
   - Use ast-grep to verify all usages updated

4. **Verify** (dotnet test, semgrep, supabase)
   - Run tests after each change
   - Scan with semgrep for security regressions
   - Check error rates with supabase analytics
   - Validate functionality unchanged

5. **Database Changes** (supabase, semgrep)
   - Create migrations with supabase
   - Scan SQL with semgrep
   - Test migrations on dev database
   - Deploy to production

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCPs not showing up?
**Solution**: Restart Claude Code (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")

### ast-grep queries failing?
```bash
npm list -g @notprolands/ast-grep-mcp
```

### Supabase MCP not connecting?
```bash
# Verify installation
npm list -g @supabase/mcp-server-supabase

# Check environment variables
echo $SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
```

### Vibe Check not responding?
```bash
npm list -g vibe-check-mcp
npx vibe-check-mcp --stdio
```

### Semgrep scan fails?
```bash
curl https://mcp.semgrep.ai/health
```

### GitHub MCP not authenticating?
**Solution**: Check GitHub Copilot subscription is active

### Stripe MCP returning 403?
**Solution**: Verify Stripe API keys in environment variables
