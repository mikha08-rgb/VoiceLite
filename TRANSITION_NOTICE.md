# ‚ö†Ô∏è VoiceLite is Now Closed Source

As of **January 2025**, VoiceLite has transitioned from open source to proprietary software.

## Why the Change?

After careful consideration, we've decided to close-source VoiceLite to:

- **Focus on Quality**: Faster development without the overhead of community management
- **Professional Security**: Dedicated security audits instead of crowdsourced review
- **Better Support**: Build a dedicated support team for our users
- **Sustainable Development**: Create a sustainable business model to fund ongoing development

## What About v1.0.66?

The **last open source version (v1.0.66)** remains available under the MIT License:

- **Download**: [v1.0.66-final-oss Release](https://github.com/mikha08-rgb/VoiceLite/releases/tag/v1.0.66-final-oss)
- **License**: MIT License - Fork it, modify it, use it commercially
- **Your Rights**: All MIT License terms still apply to v1.0.66 and earlier versions

## Future Versions (v1.1.0+)

All versions starting from **v1.1.0** are proprietary:

- **License**: Proprietary license (all rights reserved)
- **Download**: Available exclusively from [voicelite.app](https://voicelite.app)
- **Support**: Professional email support included
- **Updates**: Regular updates and security patches

## For Existing Forks

If you forked VoiceLite before this transition:

- ‚úÖ You can continue using v1.0.66 code under MIT License
- ‚úÖ You can modify and distribute your fork (MIT License applies)
- ‚ùå You cannot claim it's "official VoiceLite" or use our branding
- ‚ùå Trademark "VoiceLite" remains protected
- ‚ùå You cannot incorporate code from v1.1.0+ (closed source)

## Privacy & Transparency

We understand privacy is important to our users:

- **Third-Party Audits**: We're commissioning professional security audits
- **Transparency Reports**: We'll publish transparency reports confirming no cloud uploads
- **Open Communication**: Contact us anytime at support@voicelite.app
