# VoiceLite Launch Plan - From Code to Revenue

## 🚀 Phase 1: Quick Manual Launch (3-5 days)
**Goal: Start selling immediately with manual license delivery**

### Day 1-2: Simple License Server

POST /api/validate   - Check if license is valid
POST /api/generate   - Generate new license (admin)
GET  /api/check      - Health check
```

**Quick Implementation:**
1. Use SQLite database (simple, no setup)
2. Deploy on free Heroku/Railway ($0)
3. Basic API key authentication
4. Store: email, license_key, machine_id, activation_date

### Day 2-3: Manual Sales Process
**Immediate revenue without Paddle:**
1. Create simple Stripe Payment Link ($29/$59/$199)

   - You generate license key
   - Email key to customer
