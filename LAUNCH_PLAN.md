# VoiceLite Launch Plan ‚Äì Free Edition Roadmap

> **Status (2025):** VoiceLite no longer ships with paid tiers or license enforcement. This plan
> focuses on distributing the free build, growing adoption, and offering optional support paths.

## üöÄ Phase 1 (Week 1): Ship the Free Build

### 1. Engineering Checklist
- [ ] Final regression pass on recording, model downloads, settings persistence
- [ ] Verify Whisper medium download flow and fallback messaging
- [ ] Ensure docs mention no license requirement (README, Quick Start, installer copy)
- [ ] Tag release (`vX.Y.Z`) and publish installer + portable build on GitHub Releases

### 2. Distribution Assets
- Landing page (`docs/index.html`) updated with ‚ÄúFree Forever‚Äù messaging and direct download
- Screenshots / GIFs of main UX (press-to-talk, settings modal)
- Blog post announcing the free move + key differentiators (offline, accurate, fast)

### 3. Support Readiness
- Lightweight FAQ covering install, model downloads, troubleshooting
- GitHub Issue templates (Bug / Question / Feature request)
- Optional community channel (Discord/Slack) for feedback

## üì£ Phase 2 (Week 2-3): Grow Awareness

### Content & Community
- Publish tutorial video (setup + real-time transcription demo)
- Cross-post announcement to Windows productivity groups, accessibility forums, AI communities
- Highlight privacy/offline benefits compared to cloud competitors

### Partnerships & Goodwill
- Reach out to accessibility advocates, educators, open-source newsletters
- Offer ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù / case studies for people using VoiceLite in workflows
- Encourage GitHub stars and contributions (issues labelled `good-first-issue`)

### Optional Funding Streams (Non-blocking)
- Add donation links (BuyMeACoffee, Patreon, GitHub Sponsors)
- Offer paid consulting/support contract messaging in README (optional)

## üìà Phase 3 (Month 2+): Sustain & Iterate

### Product Enhancements
- Auto-updater to streamline future releases
- Multi-language model bundles (guided download experience)
- Shared settings backup/export
- Advanced workflows (macros, templated text snippets)

### Ecosystem Growth
- Encourage community PRs (model benchmarking, UI themes)
- Create integration guides (e.g., pairing with OBS, streaming setups, note-taking apps)
- Host periodic live sessions or office hours for feedback

### Success Metrics
- Download counts (GitHub releases, landing page analytics)
- Active community size (Discord/Slack members, newsletter subscribers)
- Issue closure velocity & community contributions

## üõ† Legacy Monetization (Optional)
Maintaining an older commercial fork? Consult the archival docs:
- `DEPLOY_LICENSE_SERVER.md`
- `MONETIZATION_FIXED.md`

Otherwise, keep the focus on a polished, frictionless free experience! üé§‚ú®
