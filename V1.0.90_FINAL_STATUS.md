---

## üéâ PROBLEM SOLVED!

### What We Discovered:
You tested the **locally-built installer** (`VoiceLite-Setup-1.0.90.exe` in project root) which had the fix and worked perfectly. However, when you downloaded from the **website**, it was still serving an older version or cached response.

### Current Status (Verified):
‚úÖ **GitHub Release**: v1.0.90 live with fix (commit `0f0d236`)
‚úÖ **Website**: Now serving v1.0.90 from GitHub
‚úÖ **API Endpoint**: Returns correct version (`VoiceLite-Setup-1.0.90.exe`)
‚úÖ **Fix Verified**: Commit `0f0d236` contains the transcription fix

## üîß The Critical Fix

### Root Cause (AudioRecorder.cs line 472):
```csharp
// BROKEN CODE (v1.0.88):
if (AudioFileReady != null) {  // Event had no subscribers!
    SaveMemoryBufferToTempFile(audioData);
}
// Result: File never saved ‚Üí transcription never triggered
```

### The Fix (AudioRecorder.cs lines 471-473):
```csharp
// FIXED CODE (v1.0.90):
// CRITICAL FIX: Always save to temp file for transcription
// Don't depend on event subscribers - the file is needed regardless
SaveMemoryBufferToTempFile(audioData);
// Result: Transcription works every time!
```

## üéØ Why It Works Now

### Timeline of the Bug:
1. **v1.0.88**: Released with transcription broken (conditional check prevented file save)

### Why Local Build Worked But Website Didn't:

- Website (initially): Served cached/old version ‚Üí **Didn't work** ‚ùå
- Website (now): Serving v1.0.90 with fix ‚Üí **Should work** ‚úÖ
