## HackerNews Post

### Title
**Show HN: VoiceLite ‚Äì Offline voice typing for Windows with auditable code**

### Post Body
```
I built VoiceLite because I wanted voice typing that actually works for coding and doesn't upload my voice to the cloud.

It's 100% offline using OpenAI's Whisper AI. Hold a hotkey, speak, release ‚Üí text appears anywhere in Windows (VS Code, terminal, browsers, games).

**Why I open sourced the core:**
Voice typing requires microphone access. I wanted users to audit the code and verify there's no telemetry. The entire audio pipeline is MIT licensed and available on GitHub.

**How I monetize:**
Free tier uses Tiny model (fast, 85% accuracy). Pro tier ($20/3mo) unlocks premium models with 95%+ accuracy on technical terms. Pro validation is server-side, so the business model is compatible with open source.

**Tech details:**
- whisper.cpp for inference
- NAudio for audio capture
- Ed25519 license signing
- Stripe for subscriptions

**Performance:**
- <200ms latency (speech to text)
- <100MB RAM idle
- Supports Tiny/Base/Small/Medium/Large models

Code: https://github.com/mikha08-rgb/VoiceLite

Happy to answer questions about the architecture, monetization, or Whisper integration!

### First Comment (Add Immediately After Posting)
```
Author here! Quick demo:

[Insert GIF/video link]

Some interesting technical challenges I solved:
1. Audio preprocessing (noise gate + AGC) for better accuracy
2. Process pooling for Whisper to reduce cold start latency
3. Server-side license validation that doesn't break offline functionality

The hardest part was balancing "open source for trust" with "monetization for sustainability".
Inspired by GitLab's open core model.

What would you use voice typing for?

**Title:** I built an open core voice typing app for Windows (MIT licensed, offline)

**Body:**
```
VoiceLite lets you dictate text anywhere in Windows. Hold Alt, speak, release ‚Üí text appears. 100% offline using Whisper AI.

**Why open core?**
- Core is MIT licensed (auditable for privacy)
- Free tier is fully functional (not a demo)
- Pro tier unlocks premium AI models ($20/3mo)
- License validation is server-side (not in repo)

**Why I think this model works:**
- Users can verify privacy claims (no cloud uploads)
- Free tier drives adoption
- Pro tier funds development
- Similar to GitLab/Sentry model

**Stats after 1 week of private beta:**
- 200 free users
- 12 paid conversions (6% conversion rate)
- $240 MRR (quarterly + lifetime mix)

### r/Windows10, r/Windows11
**Title:** Free offline voice typing for Windows that actually works (95%+ accuracy)

**Body:**
```
I got tired of Dragon costing $300+ and Windows Speech Recognition being terrible, so I built VoiceLite.

**How it works:**
1. Hold Left Alt (customizable)
2. Speak naturally
3. Release ‚Üí text appears

**Works in:** VS Code, Discord, Chrome, Terminal, Word, Games (windowed)

**100% offline** using OpenAI Whisper AI. Your voice never leaves your PC.

**Free tier:** Tiny model (fast, good accuracy)
**Pro tier:** Premium models ($20/3mo) for 95%+ accuracy on technical stuff

**Why I built this:**
- Dragon is expensive ($300+)
- Windows Speech Recognition sucks for coding
- Google/Azure require internet (privacy concern)
- Talon is great but steep learning curve

Download: https://voicelite.app
Source (MIT): https://github.com/mikha08-rgb/VoiceLite

Works great for dictating emails, coding, writing docs. Give it a try!

**How it works:**
- Powered by OpenAI Whisper AI (runs locally)
- Recognizes: useState, npm, git, forEach, async/await, etc.
- 100% offline (your voice never leaves your PC)
- Works in VS Code, terminal, any editor

**Free tier:** Tiny model (85% accuracy)
**Pro tier:** Premium models (95%+ accuracy on technical terms)

**Open core:** Core is MIT licensed, Pro features are server-gated.
