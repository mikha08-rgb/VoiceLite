# GitHub Actions Workflow Changes for Code Signing

## Summary

**Total changes needed: 2 new steps (10 lines of YAML)**

**Impact on your workflow: ZERO**
- Same git commands
- Same tag/push process
- Just wait 45 seconds longer for builds

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Purchase SSL.com Certificate ($199/year)

https://www.ssl.com/certificates/ev-code-signing/

After purchase and verification (7 days), you'll receive:
- Username
- Password
- TOTP secret (2FA)

---

### 2. Add Secrets to GitHub (5 minutes)

Go to: `https://github.com/[your-repo]/settings/secrets/actions`

Click "New repository secret" and add:

| Name | Value | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| `ESIGNER_USERNAME` | Your SSL.com username | `your-email@example.com` |
| `ESIGNER_PASSWORD` | Your SSL.com password | `YourP@ssw0rd` |
| `ESIGNER_TOTP` | Your 2FA secret | `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP` |

**Security**: These are encrypted by GitHub, never visible in logs.

---

### 3. Update Workflow File (2 minutes)

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Add these 2 steps:**

#### Step 1: After line 112 (after "Build Release")

```yaml
    - name: Code Sign VoiceLite.exe
      uses: sslcom/esigner-codesign@develop
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_PASSWORD }}
        totp-secret: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_TOTP }}
        file-path: VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/VoiceLite.exe
```

#### Step 2: After line 190 (after "Compile installer")

```yaml
    - name: Code Sign Installer
      uses: sslcom/esigner-codesign@develop
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_PASSWORD }}
        totp-secret: ${{ secrets.ESIGNER_TOTP }}
        file-path: VoiceLite-Setup-*.exe
```

**Complete updated file**: See `release-with-signing.yml.DRAFT`

---

### 4. Test Signing (First Release)

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git commit -m "test: code signing setup"
git tag v1.0.97
git push --tags

# Watch GitHub Actions (takes ~6 minutes)
# Look for:
#   ‚úì Code Sign VoiceLite.exe
#   ‚úì Code Sign Installer

# Download installer from Releases
# Verify signature:
Get-AuthenticodeSignature VoiceLite-Setup-1.0.97.exe

# Should show:
# Status: Valid
# SignerCertificate: CN=VoiceLite Software, ...
```

---

## What Changes in Your Workflow?

### Before Signing
```bash
git commit -m "fix: bug"
git tag v1.0.98
git push --tags

# GitHub Actions (5 minutes):
‚úì Build
‚úì Compile installer
‚úì Create release

# Result: Unsigned installer
```

### After Signing
```bash
git commit -m "fix: bug"
git tag v1.0.98
git push --tags

# GitHub Actions (6 minutes):
‚úì Build
‚úì Sign executable ‚Üê NEW (20s)
‚úì Compile installer
‚úì Sign installer ‚Üê NEW (25s)
‚úì Create release

# Result: SIGNED installer
```

**Your commands: IDENTICAL**
**Build time: +45 seconds**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "Authentication failed"
**Cause**: Wrong secrets in GitHub
**Fix**:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify ESIGNER_USERNAME, ESIGNER_PASSWORD, ESIGNER_TOTP
3. Re-push tag: `git push --delete origin v1.0.97 && git push --tags`

### Build Fails: "File not found"
**Cause**: Wrong file path
**Fix**: Check the file path in workflow matches actual build output
- Expected: `VoiceLite/VoiceLite/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/VoiceLite.exe`
- Check: Look at "Build Release" step output in GitHub Actions logs

### Signature Shows as Invalid
**Cause**: Certificate not yet activated OR timestamp server down
**Fix**:
1. Verify certificate is active in SSL.com dashboard
2. Wait 10 minutes (timestamp server lag)
3. Re-sign: `git push --delete origin v1.0.97 && git push --tags`

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need to change anything in my local development?**
A: No. Keep coding, committing, tagging, pushing exactly as you do now.

**Q: What if I want to test a build locally without signing?**
A: Just run `dotnet build` - signing only happens in GitHub Actions.

**Q: Do I need to re-sign every release?**
A: Yes, but it's automatic. You do nothing - GitHub Actions handles it.

**Q: What if my certificate expires?**
A: Renew for $199/year. Old signed releases stay valid (timestamped).

**Q: Can I use this certificate for other projects?**
A: Yes! One cert signs unlimited projects/files.
